10001,17 β-Oestradiol indirectly inhibits thyrotrophin-releasing hormone expression in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus of female rats and blunts thyroid axis response to cold exposure,2009,Jean-Louis Joseph Marie Charli Casalonga,Instituto de Biotecnología (IBt),,,,10.1111/j.1365-2826.2009.01861.x,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-64849108155&doi=10.1111%2fj.1365-2826.2009.01861.x&partnerID=40&md5=2bfde7af0c796ed7aa5556a9a0a97eb0,SIAV,Biology; Neuroscience,"Corticosterone; Prolactin; T3; Thyrotrophin.; TRH; Triiodothyronine;corticosterone; estradiol benzoate; estrogen receptor alpha; liothyronine; messenger RNA; prolactin; protirelin; thyrotropin; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; autonomic nervous system; body weight; cold exposure; cold tolerance; controlled study; corticosterone blood level; enzyme activation; enzyme inhibition; estradiol blood level; female; hormone release; hormone substitution; hypothalamus periventricular nucleus; in situ hybridization; liothyronine blood level; nonhuman; Northern blotting; ovariectomy; priority journal; prolactin blood level; protein expression; radioimmunoassay; rat; receptor sensitivity; thyrotropin blood level; Animals; Body Weight; Cold Temperature; Corticosterone; Estradiol; Estrogen Receptor alpha; Female; Humans; Neurons; Ovariectomy; Paraventricular Hypothalamic Nucleus; Prolactin; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Thyroid Gland; Thyrotropin-Releasing Hormone; Triiodothyronine","Energy expenditure and thermogenesis are regultated by thyroid and sex hormones. Several parameters of hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis function are modulated by 17β-oestradiol (E2) but its effects on thyrotrophin-releasing hormone (TRH) mRNA levels remain unknown. We evaluated, by in situ hybridisation and Northern bloting, TRH expression in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) of cycling rats, 2 weeks-ovariectomised (OVX) and OVX animals injected s.c. during 1-4days with E2 (5, 50, 100 or 200 μg/kg) (OVX-E). Serum levels of E2, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), prolactin, corticosterone and triiodothyronine (T3) were quantified by radioimmunoassay. Increased serum E2 levels were observed after 4 days injection of 50 μg/kg E2 (to 68.5 ± 4.8pg/ml) in OVX rats. PVN-TRH mRNA levels were slightly higher in OVX than in virgin females at dioestrous 1 or pro-oestrous, decreasing proportionally to increased serum E2 levels. E2 injections augmented serum T3, prolactin, and corticosterone levels. Serum TSH levels augmented with 4 days 50 μg/kg E2, but not with the higher doses that enhanced serum T3 levels. Exposure to cold for 1h resulted in marked HPT axis activation in OVX rats, increasing the levels of TRH mRNA along the rostro-caudal PVN areas, as well as serum TSH, T3, corticosterone and prolactin levels. By contrast, no significant changes in any of these parameters were observed in cold-exposed OVX-E (50 μg/kg E2) rats. Very few PVN-TRHergic neurones expressed the oestrogen receptor type-α suggesting that the effects of E2 on PVN-TRH expression are indirect, most probably as a result of its multiple modulatory effects on circulating hormones and their receptor sensitivity. The blunted response of OVX-E rats to cold coincides with the effects of E2 on the autonomic nervous system and increased cold tolerance. © Journal compilation © 2009 Blackwell Publishing."

The pesticide 2,4-D is one of the most widely used herbicides in the world, it belongs to the group of synthetic herbicides that control broadleaf weeds. In this paper the risk of groundwater contamination by 24-D and its major metabolite, 2,4-DCP, is studied in a context of high density of soil worms. We compared the adsorption, desorption, degradation and displacement of 2,4-D in soils from Tabasco Region having different properties: clay, organic matter, iron and aluminum oxides contents. In addition to the classical soil physicochemical characterizations, a 3D analysis of the soil structure and porosity was performed by analyzing images acquired by Computed Tomography. The objective was to evaluate the effect of soil properties and macroporosity produced by the macrofauna activity on solute movement.All the four soils studied sorbed the herbicides, more importantly 2,4-DCP, the metabolite, than 2,4-D itself. The distribution coefficients for 2,4-D sorption were linear and varied between 1 and 4 while those for 2,4-DCP were above 10. The contents of iron and aluminum have an important role in the adsorption of these two compounds. In aerobic conditions, the herbicides half-life was about 2 days. Water movement occurred in physical equilibrium in three of the four soils; soil dispersivity ranged from 1.2 to 7 cm, clay content being the main factor. After 20 to 60 days depending on the soil, no 2,4-D leaching was observed through the soil columns, except for one soil were there was preferential flow. Earthworms burrows were exhibited and quantified in the soils samples through the analysis of Computer Tomography (CT) images, they appeared as small, snail-shaped, rounded volume of 3 to 7 mm radius with a higher density with respect to the surrounding soil. They were extracted from the original data using a combination of image processing and mathematical morphology operators. Based on the results obtained, it can be concluded that preferential flow caused by both high clay content and the presence of macrofauna pores significantly reduces the buffering capacity of the soil, increasing the risk of contamination by herbicides of the underlying aquifer."

The proposed binary notation is based on the orthogonal direction change chain code. Thus, using the proposed binary chain code it is possible to represent any 3D curve by only two states (""0"" and ""1""). The proposed binary chain code produces a curve descriptor which is invariant under translation, rotation and may be starting point normalized. Also, we define the complementary chain of a 3D curve which produces the mirror image of the curve. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

We propose the use of CT-images to construct the Mechanical Computational Model. The image obtained from the CT-Scan give us a 3D model of the pores system of the monolith. This system relates the internal connectivity between different pores and the soil volume. To simulate fluid-solid interaction and the mechanical properties of the soil monolith model we used Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics. This method has a proven track report to solve multistate interaction. As SPH relies on a set of points without using a Tetrahedral Mesh representation, we can relate easily the intensity value of each pixel of the CT-Scan images (related to density values) to our 3D point data set.

Threads run concurrently in shared-memory multi-core systems, and programs run in different servers communicating by sending messages to each other. Concurrent programming is hard because it requires to cope with many possible, unpredictable behaviors of the processes, and the communication media. The article argues that right from the start in 1960's, the main way of dealing with concurrency has been by reduction to sequential reasoning. It traces this history, and illustrates it through several examples, from early ideas based on mutual exclusion (which was initially introduced to access shared physical resources), passing through consensus and concurrent objects (which are immaterial data), until today distributed ledgers. A discussion is also presented, which addresses the limits that this approach encounters, related to fault-tolerance, performance, and inherently concurrent problems."

As [4], our algorithm comprises the so-called phase 1 of coordinated checkpointing, only, which - under reasonable progress assumptions - ensures that all the local checkpoints will be taken.

Recent efforts concentrate on pure-strategy games, where intelligent agents act deterministically guided by utility functions. We build upon this tradition by incorporating stochastic actions.

Loop agreement tasks form a lattice under this notion of implementation. This paper presents a classification of loop agreement tasks. Each loop agreement task can be assigned an algebraic signature consisting of a finitely presented group G and a distinguished element g in G. This signature characterizes the task's power to implement other tasks. If :F and G are loop agreement tasks with respective signatures <F, f> and <G, g>, then F implements G if and only if there exists a group homomorphism h : F --> G carrying f to g.

A benchmarking study of enhanced techniques for real-time corrosion monitoring such as Linear Polarization Resistance and Harmonic Distortion Analysis was performed, enhanced Electrical Resistance in conjunction with standard metal coupon. The transition of the corrosion processes occurring in metals immersed in corrosive electrolytes at the onset of inhibitor action after its injection was found a revealing item for study. This study considered a 3% NaCl solution with and without 10% diesel, saturated with CO2 at 50 ºC and standard AISI 1018 coupons. A set of generic corrosion imidazoline-based inhibitors was studied. The benefits of employing real-time corrosion monitoring devices include shortened test times, increased number of inhibitors evaluated, and an increase in data quality and quantity. Results show that the corrosion rates from linear polarization resistance in the solution without inhibitor were overestimated, while the Harmonic Distortion Analysis and enhanced Electrical Resistance presented similar results to Standard Coupon. The enhanced electrical resistance monitoring also proved to be a good device to reveal the onset of corrosion protection after the inhibitor is applied. © 2019, Universidad de Tarapaca.

Since image textures possess spatial continuity at both local and global scales, they are widely used to perform tasks such as object segmentation or surface analysis. Based on the fact that the human visual system (HVS) can segment textures robustly, many texture segmentation schemes use biological models. Modern theories about the functioning of the HVS lead us think that the visual process takes advantage of image redundancy at different scales and orientations, therefore it can be modeled by a bank of Gabor wavelets. Despite the fact that Gabor wavelets optimize the theoretical limit of joint resolution between space and frequency domain, they do not have zero-mean, which induces a DC component in the coefficient of any frequency band. In addition, they do not have a uniform coverage of the frequency domain. These drawbacks may cause errors in the extraction of the appropriate texture features. In this paper, we present a modification of log-Gabor wavelets that allows eliminate DC component. They can yield a fairly uniform coverage of the frequency domain in an octave scale scheme and preserve redundancy at the same time. We analyzed performance of both Gabor and log-Gabor wavelets using a modification of Jain's unsupervised texture segmentation algorithm [1] and we compared results using confusion matrices."

These local distributions -called textures- characterize object surfaces and are used for pattern identification and recognition of images. However, some spatial patterns may vary from quite simple stripes to randomness, where textures look like unstructured noise. Since textures can exhibit a large number of properties such as surface materials and geometry of the lighting sources, many different approaches have been proposed. A featured method is the modification of Wang's algorithm made by Ojala et al, the so-called local binary patterns (LBP). The LBP algorithm uses a 3 × 3 square mask named ""texture spectrum"" which represents a neighborhood around a central pixel. The values in the square mask are compared with the central pixel and then multiplied by a weighting function according with their positions. This technique has become popular due to its computational simplicity and more importantly for encoding a powerful signature for describing textures. Specially, it has gained increased importance in image classification, where the success not only depends on a robust classifier but also relies in a good selection of the feature descriptors. However, Ojala's algorithm presents some limitations such as noise sensitivity and lack of invariance to rotational changes. This fact has fostered many extensions of the original LBP approach that in many cases are based on minor changes in order to attain e.g. illumination and rotational invariance or improving the robustness to noise. In this paper we present a detailed overview of the LBP algorithm and other recently modifications. In addition, we perform a texture classification study with seven algorithms in presence of rotational changes, noise degradation, contrast information, and different sizes of LBP masks using the USC-SIPI database. The LBP histograms have been evaluated using the Kullback-Leibler distance. This study will be a valuable insight for establishing a robust and efficient texture descriptor to solve real world problems. © 2012 SPIE."

EndMT requires a lack of VEGFA and sufficient oxygen in the extracellular microenvironment as well as no FLI1 and GATA2 activity within the cell. Additionally Tip cells cannot undergo EndMT directly. Furthermore, the specific conditions that are sufficient to trigger EndMT depend on the specific pattern of molecular activation within the cell. © Copyright © 2020 Weinstein, Mendoza and Álvarez-Buylla."

The inputs for the identification is the rate of insulin (μU/dl/min) applied to the patient, and blood glucose concentration. The output is insulin concentration (μU/ml) present in the blood stream. Once completed the off-line modeling, this model could be used for on-line monitoring of the insulin concentration for a better treatment. The learning law of the recurrent neural network is inspired by adaptive observer theory, and proven to be convergent in the parameters and stable in the Lyapunov sense, even with only 13 samples available.

In this task, the two processes start with a private input value in the set , and after communicating, each one must decide a binary output value, so that the outputs of the processes are the same if and only if the input values of the processes are different. This task is already known to be unsolvable; our goal here is to prove this result using the dynamic epistemic logic (DEL) approach introduced by Goubault et al. (2018) [18]. We show that in fact, there is no epistemic logic formula that explains why the task is unsolvable. Furthermore, we observe that this task is a particular case of an epistemic covering task. We thus establish a connection between the existing DEL framework and the theory of covering spaces in topology, and prove that the same result holds for any epistemic covering task: no epistemic formula explains the unsolvability."

Several modeling efforts have been used to integrate the complex network of interacting molecular components involved in cell cycle dynamics. In this paper, we aimed at recovering the regulatory logic upstream of previously known components of cell cycle control, with the aim of understanding the mechanisms underlying the emergence of the cyclic behavior of such components. We focus on Arabidopsis thaliana, but given that many components of cell cycle regulation are conserved among eukaryotes, when experimental data for this system was not available, we considered experimental results from yeast and animal systems. We are proposing a Boolean gene regulatory network (GRN) that converges into only one robust limit cycle attractor that closely resembles the cyclic behavior of the key cell-cycle molecular components and other regulators considered here. We validate the model by comparing our in silico configurations with data from loss- and gain-of-function mutants, where the endocyclic behavior also was recovered. Additionally, we approximate a continuous model and recovered the temporal periodic expression profiles of the cell-cycle molecular components involved, thus suggesting that the single limit cycle attractor recovered with the Boolean model is not an artifact of its discrete and synchronous nature, but rather an emergent consequence of the inherent characteristics of the regulatory logic proposed here. This dynamical model, hence provides a novel theoretical framework to address cell cycle regulation in plants, and it can also be used to propose novel predictions regarding cell cycle regulation in other eukaryotes. © 2015 Ortiz-Gutiérrez et al."

Phenomenological accounts of body memory describe its effects using dynamical metaphors: it is conceived of as curvatures in an agent-environment relational field, leading to attracting and repelling forces that shape ongoing sensorimotor interaction. This relational perspective stands in tension with traditional cognitive science, which conceives of the underlying basis of memory in representational-internal terms: it is the encoding and storing of informational content via structural changes inside the brain. We propose that this tension can be resolved by replacing the traditional approach with the dynamical approach to cognitive science. Specifically, we present three of our simulation models of embodied cognition that can help us to rethink the basis of several types of body memory. The upshot is that, at least in principle, there is no need to explain their basis in terms of content or to restrict their basis to neuroplasticity alone. Instead these models support the perspective developed by phenomenology: body memory is a relational property of a whole brain-body-environment system that emerges out of its history of interactions."

We choose Elliptic Curve Cryptography to secure the network since it offers faster computation and good security with shorter keys. In order to minimize the running time, we propose to split and distribute the computation of scalar multiplications by involving neighboring nodes in this operation. In order to improve the reliability, we have also proposed a fault tolerance mechanism. It uses half of the available cluster members as backup nodes which take over the work of faulty nodes in case of system failure. Parallel computing does consume more resources, but the results of simulation show that the computation can be significantly accelerated. This method is designed specially for applications where running time is the most important factor."

However, this approach tends to be complex in terms of time delays, and the inherent local phase is missing. Therefore, it is necessary to study the behavior of the delays as well as the integration of the differential equations of these bounded delays. The related time delays need to be known a priori, but from a dynamic real-time perspective in order to understand the dynamic phase behavior. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the inclusion of the data frequency transmission and time delays that are bounded as parameters of the dynamic response from a real-time scheduling approximation, considering the local phase situation. The related control law is designed considering a fuzzy logic approximation for nonlinear time delays coupling. The main advantage is the integration of this behavior through extended state space representation. This keeps certain linear and bounded behavior leading to a stable situation during an events presentation, based on an accurate data transmission rate. An expected result is that the basics of the local phase missing as a result of the local bounded time delays from the lack of tide synchronization conforms to the modeling approximation. © 2006-2015 by CCC Publications."

The problem of visuomotor coordination in toads is studied through the integration of two different approaches: a top-down approach through schema theory developed in the studies of cognitive psychology, artificial intelligence and brain theory; and a bottom-up approach through the integration of physiological, anatomical, ethological, and neural modelling. The model proposes that visual information is processed in a parallel distributed way through different brain layers whose interaction defines the proper motor response for that specific situation. It is postulated that visual processing of information is organized into main schemata, which set the goal to be attained and, depending on the specific circumstances of the animal, activates different brain layers; the main schemata may use other schemata to solve a specific subproblem to reach the schema goal state. A schema is consistuted by perceptual and motor schemata, and a programme of schema co-ordination. With this model we have simulated how toads plan their route to reach a prey or the route to go away from a predator, depending on the state of their three-dimensional world. The model postulates specific hypotheses that could be tested experimentally on the processing of information in the toad's nervous system. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved."

Previous attempts of simulating conversations in grammar systems used rewriting rules, which remained fix and unchangeable during the whole dialogue. The novelty of this approach is that taking inspiration from a Multi Agent Protocol language we define a grammatical system in which agents (grammars) behaviours are given by string process descriptions or protocols. Strings can be modified during running time, allowing to dynamically alter agent behaviour according to the environmental changes. This provides agents with a more flexible and adaptative reaction to unpredictable and changeable conversational space. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006."

This paper shows how language evolution can be modeled using Adaptable Grammars, which may be defined as logically based transformational grammars in which the grammar itself may be affected in a derivation step."

The method uses a heuristically determined feedback function for the compensation of the system response and a neural network model. It is assumed that changes in the system parameters can lead to an increase in the magnitude of the residual signal. In this case, the residual is formulated as the difference of the system output and the neural network model output. A fault is normally associated with an unexpected increase in the residual signal. Therefore, the residual is constantly monitored to detect the fault and to start the compensation algorithm. In addition, the residual is fed back through a compensation block. Thus fault tolerance is achieved by adjusting the control signal of the failed system such that the residual signal approaches its original faultless magnitude. The mathematical form of the compensation block is defined by a combination of experimentation and heuristic knowledge of the response of the system"

In a recent work we have applied the condition based approach to the interactive consistency (IC) problem (the agreement problem where the processes have to agree on the vector of proposed values), and provided a characterization of the conditions that allow us to solve it in presence of up to f(c) process crashes and f(e) erroneous proposals. We have shown that these conditions correspond exactly to error correcting codes, where the errors can be erasures or modified values. Here, we investigate this set of conditions from a complexity perspective, and show that it actually consists of a hierarchy of classes of conditions, C-fc,fe([delta]), where delta is the degree of the condition (0 less than or equal to delta less than or equal to f(c)), each class being contained in the previous one (intuitively, the value f(c) - delta represents the difficulty of a class)."

These parameters are fundamental to retrieve three-dimensional reconstruction of eyes structure, in our case, retinal blood vessels. In this paper we used the Zhangs algorithm to estimate the intrinsic parameters of the optical system. Besides, an alternative method to estimate the extrinsic parameters is proposed based on the kinect one sensor. These modifications provide an easy way to characterise the whole fundus camera system. Experimental validation was carried out to verify the accuracy of the proposed method. A cylindrical known object was reconstructed having and average error of 3.96%. A real eyes structure was also reconstructed from a fundus image pair."

We identified that this drug-target interaction network cannot be divided into two disjoint and independent sets, i.e., it is not bipartite.

In this regard, the histamine H1 receptor, which belongs to the family of rhodopsin-like G-protein-coupled receptors and is activated by the biogenic amine histamine, was found to be the most important node in the centrality of input-degrees. In the case of centrality of output-degrees, fostamatinib was found to be the most important node, as this drug interacts with 300 different targets, including arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase or ALOX5, expressed on cells primarily involved in regulation of immune responses. The top 10 hubs interacted with 33% of the target genes. Fostamatinib stands out because it is used for the treatment of chronic immune thrombocytopenia in adults. Finally, 187 highly connected sets of nodes, structured in communities, were also identified. Indeed, the largest communities have more than 400 elements and are related to metabolic diseases, psychiatric disorders and cancer.

Using layering, a model-independent analysis of the consensus problem is performed and then applied to proving lower bounds and impossibility results for consensus in a number of familiar and less familiar models. The proofs are simpler and more direct than existing ones, and they expose a unified structure to the difficulty of reaching consensus. In particular, the proofs for the classical synchronous and asynchronous models now follow the same outline. A new notion of connectivity among states in runs of a consensus protocol, called potence connectivity, is introduced. This notion is more general than previous notions of connectivity used for this purpose and plays a key role in the uniform analysis of consensus."

Typical segmentation of the endocardium wall in the ventricle excludes papillary muscles which leads to an incorrect measure of the ejected volume in the LV. In this paper we present a new variational strategy using a 2D level set framework that includes a local term for enhancing the low contrast structures and a 2D shape model. The shape model in the level set method is propagated to all image sequences corresponding to the cardiac cycles through the optical flow approach using the Hermite transform. To evaluate our strategy we use the Dice index and the Hausdorff distance to compare the segmentation results with the manual segmentation carried out by the physician. © 2015 SPIE.

The KB is defined as a conceptual hierarchy with inheritance that supports the expression of defaults and exceptions. All classes and individuals, with their properties and relations, can be updated dynamically and the KB-System supports non-monotonic behavior. Non-monotonicity is handled on the basis of a specificity criteria,such that more specific properties and relations have precedence over more general ones. The system supports the expression of conceptual (or terminological) and factual (or assertional) knowledge, which are used in inference in a coherent and consistent way. The KBSystem is embedded within the IOCA Architecture, where knowledge about how to communicate and interact with the world, and also knowledge of the particular interpretation situation are represented. The cognitive architecture isstructured around a main communication cycle, and queries and conceptual inferences are performed on demand during the interaction of the robot with other agents or the world. The overall structure of the KB with its main interpreter and supporting utilities as well asthe embedding ofthe KB-system in the robot’s architecture are also presented. The KB-System is illustrated with a case study in service robots scenarios, where a practical non-monotonic KB is required. Finally, the implementation of the KB-System in the robot Golem-III is described."

Most of rainfall in Mexico City is produced by convective storms, characterized by high spatial and temporal variability, which makes its estimation more difficult. This paper presents a modification of the geostatistical procedure for spatial rainfall estimation introduced by Krajewski (1987), which applies ordinary cokriging, combining meteorological radar images with rain gage data. Here, unlike Krajewski's procedure, in the ordinary cokriging method, the joint radar-ram gage spatial dependence is considered by a linear coregionalization model. The proposed methodology is tested using radar and gage data from a storm that occurred in the Valley of Mexico, and the results are compared with ordinary cokriging, without a linear coregionalization model, and collocated cokriging methods."

It is well known that cardiac affections constitute one of the main causes of death in developed and developing countries. An early detection of cardiac diseases might substantially contribute to find the correct treatment. In this work, we propose a variational framework for left ventricle (LV) segmentation of cardiac MR and CT volumes. The method is based on a multiscale scheme provided by the Hermite transform (HT) which is used for local image feature coding. The variational approach includes several functional terms embedded into a level set - based framework in which geometrical and image features computed from coefficients of the HT are processed. Methods based on level sets are commonly configured using a set of parameters which are frequently selected experimentally. In this paper, we present an automatic mechanism for parameters selection using the contrast information obtained from the input data. The method was evaluated on several cardiac CT and MR volumes. Distance metrics were used for evaluation by comparing with manual segmentations."

The shape of the different objects to be compared is mapped to a representation invariant under translation, rotation, and area. Thus, the shapes will have the same amount of information to describe them (equal number of pixels). The measure of dissimilarity is based on the transformation of one shape into another. This transformation is performed by moving pixels. Thus, the shape difference could be ascertained by counting how many pixels we have to move and how far to change one shape into another. When the shape transformation is performed, the distribution of the shape difference is computed, which permits an improvement in shape comparison."

Tortuosity is a very important property of curves and has many applications, such as: how to measure the tortuosity of retinal blood vessels, intracerebral vasculature, aluminum foams, etc. The measure of tortuosity proposed here is based on a chain code called Slope Chain Code (SCC). The SCC uses some ideas which were described in [A geometric structure for 2D shapes and 3D surfaces, Pattern Recognition 25 (1992) 483-496]. The SCC of a curve is obtained by placing straight-line segments of constant length around the curve (the endpoints of the straight-line segments always touching the curve), and calculating the slope changes between contiguous straight-line segments scaled to a continuous range from −1 to 1. The SCC of a curve is independent of translation, rotation, and optionally, of scaling, which is an important advantage for computing tortuosity. Also, the minimum and maximum values of tortuosity for curves and a measure of normalized tortuosity are described. Finally, an application of the proposed measure of tortuosity is presented which corresponds to the computation of retinal blood vessel tortuosity."

In this work, we propose a method to address the classification of pre-stack seismic data decomposed using the wavelet transform to spread the amplitude and frequency seismic attributes at the same time, which are then classified by a self-organizing map. The resulting classes constitute an attribute constructed by the joint amplitude–frequency components of the transformed pre-stack seismic gathers, which create a multi-dimensional set defined through a given metric.

This method is based on a chain code called knot numbers. The knot-number notation describes discrete knots. A discrete knot is the digitalized representation of a knot and is composed of constant orthogonal straight-line segments. The orthogonal direction changes of the contiguous straight-line segments of the knot define the chain elements. There are only five possible orthogonal direction changes for representing any discrete knot. Thus, the chain elements are considered as one base-five integer number (knot number). In this manner, we obtain a unique knot descriptor. This description is invariant under translation, rotation, starting point, and coding direction of the discrete knot. By evaluating all possible combinations of chain elements of curves and considering some restrictions, we obtain interesting families of curves which allow us to find the smallest nontrivial knot. Finally, we present a modest attempt at building the table of minimal discrete knots. © World Scientific Publishing Company."

These 3D tree objects correspond to natural existing 3D tree structures, such as: blood vessels, plants, live trees, and so on. Thus, trees are digitalized and represented by a notation called the unique tree descriptor. The unique tree descriptor is invariant under translation and rotation. Furthermore, this descriptor is starting vertex normalized via the unique path in the tree. Also, it is possible to obtain the mirror image of any tree with ease. This unique tree descriptor preserves the shape of trees (and the shape of their branches), allows us to know their geometrical and topological properties. To determine if two 3D tree objects have the same shape, it is only necessary to see if their descriptors are equal. In this manner, graph comparisons and tree searches are eliminated. Also, the proposed tree descriptor is a good tool for storing of 3D tree objects. Finally, in order to prove our method for representing 3D tree objects, we obtain some tree descriptors of objects on real images."

In this approach it is assumed that the prime factor affecting data rate selection is the path attenuation. We model the wireless channel using a multistate stochastic process where each state corresponds to the nominal data rate achieved by the station when it uses a particular combination of modulation and coding (i.e., adaptive modulation). Differently from other proposals, in the proposed model state changes are created from mobility assumptions. We illustrate the use of this model with a case study."

Brigatti (Brigatti, 2008) introduced the notion of Reputation in Baronchellis model, demonstrating how this parameter has an impact in the final results of the process. In a previous paper, we have shown that reputation is a key element in the coevolution of language and social structures in societies with asymmetrically distributed reputation. This paper presents a system for simulating linguistic convergence in static and dynamic populations with asymmetrically distributed reputation and a graphical representation of such process."

We will offer a first glimpse at data collection that crosses scales using IR, colour and depth imagery data from the millimetric to the metric scale. We used proprietary hardware and algorithms to look at the activity of Polychaete worms (a recognized indicator of a healthy estuary environment) across spatial, temporal and physical scales, from micro to macro level. While our estimation of worm counts correlated weakly with manual expert ground truth, our system allowed a scaling of worm activity at various levels, which is a first attempt at marine ecosystem meta-scale mapping capabilities. The field investigations took place on a stretch of intertidal area in the Auckland Region near the Leigh Marine Laboratory, which allows easy access to a typical marine ecosystem, ensures natural illumination, and is rich in complex interactions in the underwater biotic/abiotic interface."

This model is inspired in biological insights and it includes some important properties of human vision such as the Gaussian derivative model for early vision proposed by Young19. The image transform that we propose in this work uses similar analysis operators as the Hermite transform at multiple scales, but the synthesis scheme of our approach integrates the responses of all channels at different scales. The advantages of this scheme are: 1) both analysis and synthesis operators are Gaussian derivatives. This allows for simplicity during implementation. 2) The operator functions possess better space-frequency localization, and it is possible to separate adjacent scales one octave apart, according to Wilson's results on human vision channels16. 3) In the case of 2-D signals, it is easy to analyze local orientations at different scales. A discrete approximation is also derived from an asymptotic relation between the Gaussian derivatives and the discrete binomial filters. We show in this work how the proposed transform can be applied to the problem of image coding. Practical considerations are also of concern."

This boundary chain code is based on the numbers of cell vertices which are in touch with the bounding contour of the shape. This boundary chain code is termed vertex chain code (VCC). The VCC is invariant under translation and rotation. Also, it may be starting point normalized and invariant under mirroring transformation. Using this concept of chain code it is possible to relate the chain length to the contact perimeter, which corresponds to the sum of the boundaries of neighboring cells of the shape (Bribiesca, E., Comp. Math. Appl. 33(11) (1997) 1-9); also, to relate the chain nodes to the contact vertices, which correspond to the vertices of neighboring cells. So, in this way, these relations among the chain and the characteristics of interior of the shape allow us to obtain interesting properties. This work is motivated by the idea of obtaining various shape features computed directly from the VCC without going to Cartesian-coordinate representation. Finally, in order to illustrate the capabilities of the VCC: we present some results using real shapes. © 1999 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved."

By means of the genetic expressions obtained from a DNA microarrays, it is possible to identify which genes are correlated to a particular disease, in order solve different tasks such as tumor detection, best treatment selection, etc. In the last years, several computational intelligence techniques have been proposed to identify different groups of genes associated with a particular disease; one popular example is the application of artificial neural networks (ANN). The main disadvantage of using this technique is that ANN require a representative number of samples to provide acceptable results. However, the enormous quantity of genes and the few samples available for any disease, demand the use of more robust artificial neural models, capable of providing acceptable results using few samples during the learning process. In this research, we described a new type of generalized neuron model (GNM) applied to the DNA microarray classification task. The proposed methodology selects the set of genes that better describe the disease applying the artificial bee colony algorithm; after that, the GNM is trained using the discovered genes by means of a differential evolution algorithm. Finally, the accuracy of the proposed methodology is evaluated classifying two types of cancer using DNA microarrays: the acute lymphocytic leukemia and the acute myeloid leukemia. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019."

Obstacles reflect the light beam to the second mirror and the second mirror reflects it to the second lens. Then the focused light beam arrives at the line of optical sensors. A special electronic device gives the time of arrival of the light beam. This time is transformed to binary code for the computer. The computer transforms the binary code to the distance using the geometrical features of the rangefinder.

A special electronic device gives the time of arrival of the light beam. This time is transformed to binary code for the computer. The computer transforms the binary code to the distance using the geometrical features of the rangefinder. The range- finder with 10 optical sensors will make approximately 1,000 measurements per second. In this article the scheme of the rangefinder is described. The main parameters of the rangefinder prototype are presented. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011."

Because land plants cannot escape environmental stress they use developmental solutions to remodel themselves in order to better adapt to the new conditions. The primary site for perception of underground signals is the root cap (RC). Plant roots have positive hydrotropic response and modify their growth direction in search of water. Using a screening system with a water potential gradient, we isolated a no hydrotropic response (nhr) semi-dominant mutant of Arabidopsis that continued to grow downwardly into the medium with the lowest water potential contrary to the positive hydrotropic and negative gravitropic response seen in wild type-roots. The lack of hydrotropic response of nhr1 roots was confirmed in a system with a gradient in air moisture. The root gravitropic response of nhr1 seedlings was significantly faster in comparison with those of wild type. The frequency of the waving pattern in nhr1 roots was increased compared to those of wild type. nhr1 seedlings had abnormal root cap morphogenesis and reduced root growth sensitivity to abscisic acid (ABA) and the polar auxin transport inhibitor N-(1-naphtyl)phtalamic acid (NPA). These results showed that hydrotropism is amenable to genetic analysis and that an ABA signaling pathway participates in sensing water potential gradients through the root cap."

Due to the limited depth of field of optical lenses in CCD devices, there are sensors which cannot generate images of all objects with equal sharpness. Therefore, several images of the same scene have different focused parts. One way to overcome this problem is to take different in-focus parts and combine them into a single composite image which contains the entire focuused scene. In this paper we present a multi-focus image fusion algorithm based on feature extraction and wavelets. Classical wavelet synthesis is known to produce Gibbs phenomenon around discontinuities. The approach of wavelet on the interval transform is suitable to orthogonal wavelets and does not exhibit edge effects. Since canny filter's operator is a Gaussian derivative, a well known model of early vision, we used it to get salient edges and to build a decision map who determines which information to take and at what place. Finally, quality of fused images is assessed using both traditional and perception-based quality metrics. Quantitative and qualitative analysis of the results demonstrate higher performance of the algorithm compared to traditional methods."

Employing undecided border nodes to forward multicast packets represents a significant enhancement because it optimizes the path discovery process by selecting undecided nodes that can function as multicast relay nodes. Flooding Mechanism and On-Demand Multicast Routing Protocol (ODMRP) are simulated and compared with both the basic and enhanced versions of the Topological Multicast Routing algorithm. The scenario evaluated considers one multicast transmitter and one, two, and three multicast receivers with various mobility patterns and transmission ranges. The behavior of 250 nodes is evaluated in terms of End to End Delay (EED), jitter, packet delivery ratio, and overhead. Results reveal that the enhanced version of ToMuRo performs better in terms of packet delivery ratio and jitter, while ODMRP performs better with respect to EED and Overhead."

A computational phantom was designed to test method performance; results revealed the method's inaccuracy delta, to range between 0.1 and 0.5 voxels, for a width that varied between 1 and 7 voxels. Two morphological descriptors were computed to characterize each defined sulcus: mean sulcal width (MSW) and mean absolute deviation (MAD).

It is, however, impossible to develop a stand-alone, objective numerical algorithm for the evaluation of academic activities, because any evaluation necessarily includes subjective preference statements. In a market, the market prices represent preference statements, but scientists work largely in a non-market context. I propose a numerical algorithm that serves to determine the distribution of reward money in Mexico’s evaluation system, which uses relative prices of scientific goods and services as input. The relative prices would be determined by an evaluation committee. In this way, large evaluation systems (like Mexico’s Sistema Nacional de Investigadores) could work semi-automatically, but not arbitrarily or superficially, to determine quantitatively the academic performance of scientists every few years. Data of 73 scientists from the Biology Institute of Mexico’s National University are analyzed, and it is shown that the reward assignation and academic priorities depend heavily on those preferences. A maximum number of products or activities to be evaluated is recommended, to encourage quality over quantity. © 2015, The Author(s)."

A server broadcasts data files provided by different independent providers and accessed by many clients in a round-robin manner. The clients who access these files may have different patterns of access. Some clients may wish to access several files in any order (AND), some wish to access one out of several files (OR), and some clients may access a second file only after accessing another file (IMPLY). The goal of the server is to order the files in a way that minimizes the access time of the clients given some a priori knowledge of their access patterns. An appropriate clients-servers model was proposed by Bay-Noy, Naor and Schieber (see Proc. ACM Mobile Computing Conference, MOBICOM 2000, p.222-230, 2000). They formulated three separate problems and proposed an algorithm that evaluates certain number of random permutations and chooses the one whose access time is minimized. We formulate a combined AOI (AND-OR-IMPLY) problem, and propose to apply a parallel hill climbing algorithm (to each of the four problems), which begins from certain number of random permutations, and then applies hill climbing technique an each of them until there is no more improvement. The evaluation time of neighboring permutations generated in hill climbing process is optimized, so that it requires O(n) time per permutation instead of O(n/sup 2/) time required for evaluating access time of a random permutation, where n is the number of files the server broadcasts. Experiments indicate that the parallel hill climbing algorithm is O(n) times faster that random permutations method, both in terms of time needed to evaluate the same number of permutations, and time needed to provide a high quality solution. Thus the improvement is significant for broadcasting a large number of files."

The HT is an image representation model that incorporates important properties of the Human Vision System (HVS), such as the analysis of local orientation, and the model of Gaussian derivatives of early vision. The proposed watermarking scheme is based on a perceptive model that takes advantage of the masking characteristics of the HVS, thus allowing the generation of a watermark that cannot be detected by a human observer. The mask is constructed using a brightness model that exploits the limited sensibility of the human visual system for noise detection in areas of high or low brightness. Experimental results show the imperceptibility of the watermark and the fact that the proposed algorithm is robust to most common processing attacks. For the case of geometric distortions, an image normalization stage is carried out prior to the watermarking."

Accurate quantification of emphysema is required for a better understanding of the disease as well as for the assessment of drugs and treatments. In the present study, a novel method for emphysema characterization from histological lung images is proposed. Elastase-induced mice were used to simulate the effect of emphysema on the lungs. A database composed of 50 normal and 50 emphysematous lung patches of size 512 x 512 pixels was used in our experiments. The purpose is to automatically identify those patches containing emphysematous tissue. The proposed approach is based on the use of granulometry analysis, which provides the pattern spectrum describing the distribution of airspaces in the lung region under evaluation. The profile of the spectrum was summarized by a set of statistical features. A logistic regression model was then used to estimate the probability for a patch to be emphysematous from this feature set. An accuracy of 87% was achieved by our method in the classification between normal and emphysematous samples. This result shows the utility of our granulometry-based method to quantify the lesions due to emphysema.© 2013 SPIE."

In this case, reconfiguration is proposed in three stages. Firstly, computer network presents a degradation in time communication due to the appearance of certain local faults. Secondly, based upon this scenario a strategy for on-line reconfiguration is pursued in order to cover faults where new time delays appear between elements. These delays modify the behaviour of the dynamical response of the system. During third stage, the control law needs to be modified in terms of current time delays. Therefore, in this paper, on-line system reconfiguration as multivariable and multi-stage problem is pursued based upon a quasi-dynamic scheduler that takes into account those predetermined time delays and the related control law. Control law reconfiguration is pursued as soon as structural computer network reconfiguration is taken place by using current system performance."

It is observed that the WTFDWV acts as a band-pass filter around the instantaneous frequency. Additionally, this paper proposes a generalisation of the WTFDWV as a Warped Discrete Time Frequency Distribution Class."

Innovative niching and ranking-mutation procedures which avoid the need of parameters definition are involved; such procedures outperform traditional diversity-preservation mechanisms under spread-hardness situations. RankMOEA performance is compared with those of other state of the art MOEAs: MOGA, NSGA-II and SPEA2, showing remarkable improvements. RankMOEA is also applied to approximate the Pareto Front of a Dynamic Principal-Agent model with Discrete Actions posed in a Multi-Objective Optimization framework allowing to consider more powerful assumptions than those used in the traditional single-objective optimization approach. Within this new framework a set of feasible contracts is described, while others similar studies only focus on one single contract. The results achieved with RankMOEA show better spread and minor error than those obtained by already mentioned MOEAs, allowing to perform better economic analysis in the contracts trade-off surface.

We took this into account as we carried out the COMPETISOFT research project, which investigated software process improvement (SPI) in the context of Latin American small companies. That experience has enabled us to develop a research strategy based on the integrated use of action research and case study methods. This paper introduces the proposed research strategy and provides extensive discussion of its application for: (1) developing the Methodological framework of COMPETISOFT for SPI, (2) putting this framework into practice in eight small software companies, and (3) refine the Methodological framework due to the practice feedback. The use of this research strategy allowed us to observe that it was suitable for developing, refining, improving, applying, and validating COMPETISOFT’s Methodology framework. Furthermore, having seen it applied, we believe that this strategy offers a successful integration of action research and case study, which can be useful for conducting research in other software engineering areas which address needs of small software companies. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York."

Thanks to automation in vehicles as well as in other sectors, the probability of errors, typically due to repetitive tasks, has been drastically reduced. Therefore, technological aids in current driving systems are aimed to avoid or reduce human errors like imprudences or distractions. According to this, it is possible to tackle complex scenarios such as the automation of the vehicles traffic at intersections, as this is one of the points with the highest probability of accidents. In this sense, the coordination of autonomous vehicles at intersections is a trending topic. In the last few years, several approaches have been proposed using centralized solutions. However, centralized systems for traffic coordination have a limited fault-tolerance. This paper proposes a distributed coordination management system for intersections of autonomous vehicles through the employment of some well-defined rules to be followed by vehicles. To validate our proposal, we have developed different experiments in order to compare our proposal with other centralized approaches. Furthermore, we have incorporated the management of communication faults during the execution in our proposal. This improvement has also been tested in front of centralized or semi-centralized solutions. The introduction of failures in the communication process demonstrates the sensitivity of the system to possible disturbances, providing a satisfactory coordination of vehicles during the intersection. As final result, our proposal is kept with a suitable flow of autonomous vehicles still with a high communication fails rate."

Scenarios in which multiple cells move autonomously in all directions are not uncommon in biology. A remarkable example is the swimming of marine spermatozoa in search of the conspecific oocyte. Imaging cells in these scenarios, particularly when they move fast and are poorly labelled or even unlabelled requires very fast three-dimensional time-lapse (3D+t) imaging. This 3D+t imaging poses challenges not only to the acquisition systems but also to the image analysis algorithms. It is in this context that this work describes an original automated multiparticle segmentation method to analyse motile translucent cells in 3D microscopical volumes. The proposed segmentation technique takes advantage of the way the cell appearance changes with the distance to the focal plane position. The cells translucent properties and their interaction with light produce a specific pattern: when the cell is within or close to the focal plane, its two-dimensional (2D) appearance matches a bright spot surrounded by a dark ring, whereas when it is farther from the focal plane the cell contrast is inverted looking like a dark spot surrounded by a bright ring. The proposed method analyses the acquired video sequence frame-by-frame taking advantage of 2D image segmentation algorithms to identify and select candidate cellular sections. The crux of the method is in the sequential filtering of the candidate sections, first by template matching of the in-focus and out-of-focus templates and second by considering adjacent candidates sections in 3D.

Reliable quantification of the hazard associated with such a seismic gap is urgently needed for risk mitigation purposes by means of state-of-the-art observations and modeling. In this article, we introduce and quantitatively assess the first seismogeodetic amphibious network deployed in Mexican and Central American soils that will provide the opportunity to achieve this goal in the near future. Deployed in 2017, the network is the result of a collaborative effort between Mexican and Japanese scientists. It consists of 15 onshore broadband and 7 ocean-bottom seismometers, 33 Global Positioning System (GPS) stations, 7 ocean-bottom pressure gauges, and 2 GPSacoustic sites,most of them installed within the Guerrero seismic gap. Initial data from the network revealed the occurrence of a 6-month-long slow-slip event in Guerrero, starting in May and ending in October 2017. To illustrate the performance of the various instruments, we also present the first ocean-bottom pressure and GPS-acoustic measurements in Mexico; the latter was obtained by means of an autonomousWave Glider vehicle. The ground motion of the devastating 19 September 2017 Mw 7.1 earthquake in central Mexico is presented as well. Nominal resolution of the seismogeodetic network is estimated through different synthetic inversion tests for tomographic imaging and the seismic coupling (or slow-slip) determination on the plate interface. The tests show that combined onshore and offshore instruments should lead to unprecedented results regarding the seismic potential (i.e., interface coupling) of the seismic gap and the Earth structure from the Middle America trench up to 70-km depth across the Guerrero state. © 2018 Seismological Society of America.

Developmental and phenomenological approaches are converging on a relational hypothesis: my perception of a you is primarily constituted by another subject's attention being directed toward me. This is particularly the case when my body is being physically explored in an intentional manner. We set out to characterize the sensorimotor signature of the transition to being aware of the other by re-analyzing time series of embodied interactions between pairs of adults (recorded during a perceptual crossing experiment). Measures of turn-taking and movement synchrony were used to quantify social coordination, and transfer entropy was used to quantify direction of influence. We found that the transition leading to one's conscious perception of the other's presence was indeed characterized by a significant increase in one's passive reception of the other's tactile stimulations. Unexpectedly, one's clear experience of such passive touch was consistently followed by a switch to active touching of the other, while the other correspondingly became more passive, which suggests that this intersubjective experience was reciprocally co-regulated by both participants."

It consists in finding the minimal set of symmetry operations needed to identify unequivocally the symmetry for each state and a direct calculation of the character of the representation expanded by the vector state. The algorithm allows simple and fast calculations of the symmetry properties, even for large symmetry groups and systems with many degrees of freedom. In particular the occurrence of accidental degeneracy is distinguished clearly using this method. In order to illustrate the application of the method, we discuss the classification of the vibrational states for two different molecular systems."

AES, RC5, SkipJack and XXTEA are some symmetric-key encryption algorithms that are deployed in sensor network environments. However, these algorithms have their own weakness, such as vulnerable to chosen-plaintext attack, brute force attack and computational complexity. We propose an energy efficient lightweight encryption scheme based on pseudorandom bit sequence generated by elliptic curve operations. We present experimental results of our proposed algorithm employed on real sensor nodes operating in TinyOS. We also discuss the security strength of our algorithm by presenting the security analysis of various tests and cryptanalytic attacks."

Mathematical equations are developed in order to establish clear differences between the breath-by-breath and mixing chamber measurement based calorimeters. This simple model offers not only a physiological ICT definition approach but also defines the idea of VO2 and VCO2 short-term variability information for research. The preliminary results show a new physiological information when a computer oriented algorithm model implementation was applied to a data acquisition system in order to obtain the power spectrum analysis from a typical observation subject submitted to the clino-ortho maneuver. © 2006 IEEE.

If such an error transforms one word to another existing one, the latter cannot be detected by usual spell-checkers, since some context analysis is necessary. A simple procedure is proposed for this task. It relies on (1) some simple heuristics that determine linear context and (2) on a small list of pairs of words that differ only in accentuation mark. This idea is applied to numerous nouns or adjectives like n´umero that pass to quasi-homonymous personal verb forms if they lose their stress marks."

We propose to uncover the higher dimensional information implicit in this structure, by considering a dual, simplicial complex model. We use dynamic epistemic logic (DEL) to study how an epistemic simplicial complex model changes after a set of agents communicate with each other. We concentrate on an action model that represents the so-called immediate snapshot communication patterns of asynchronous agents, because it is central to distributed computability (but our setting works for other communication patterns). There are topological invariants preserved from the initial epistemic complex to the one after the action model is applied, which determine the knowledge that the agents gain after communication. Finally, we describe how a distributed task specification can be modeled as a DEL action model, and show that the topological invariants determine whether the task is solvable. We thus provide a bridge between DEL and the topological theory of distributed computability, which studies task solvability in a shared memory or message passing architecture."

In this classifier, an automated region-growth algorithm delineates the training sets. This algorithm handles three parameters: an initial pixel seed, a window size and a threshold for each class. A suitable pixel seed is manually implanted through visual inspection of the image classes. The best value for the window and the threshold are obtained from a spectral distance and heuristic criteria. This distance is calculated from a mathematical model of spectral separability. A pixel is incorporated into a region if a spectral homogeneity criterion is satisfied in the pixel-centered window for a given threshold. The homogeneity criterion is obtained from the model of spectral distance. The set of pixels forming a region represents a statistically valid sample of a defined class signaled by the initial pixel seed. The grown regions therefore constitute suitable training sets for each class. Comparing the statistical behavior of the pixel population of a sliding window with that of each class performs the classification. For region-growth, a window size is employed for each class. For classification, the centered pixel of the sliding window is labeled as belonging to a class if its spectral distance is a minimum to the class. The window size used for classification is a function of the best separability between the classes. A series of examples, employing synthetic and satellite images are presented to show the value of this classifier. The goodness of the segmentation is evaluated by means of the κ coefficient and a visual inspection of the results."

The results of this study indicate that it is possible to identify different materials propertied when the signals are correctly acquired and preprocessed, and the network is adequately trained."

In such a context it becomes extremely important to be able to design shared objects that can cope with the net effect of asynchrony and process crashes. This paper is a theory-oriented introduction to wait-free synchronization for such systems. It uses the adaptive renaming problem as a paradigm to explain the difficulties and subtleties of synchronization in presence of process crashes. Renaming is one of the most famous coordination problems studied in distributed computability. It consists in assigning new names to processes in such a way that no two processes obtain the same new name and the new name space be as small as possible. The paper visits the problem by presenting three solutions. This paper, that has a strong survey/short tutorial flavor, can consequently be considered as an introduction to both the renaming problem and progress conditions for synchronization in presence of process crashes in the context of multiprocessor systems."

Multiversion STM systems maintain multiple versions for each t-object. The advantage of storing multiple versions is that it facilitates successful execution of higher number of read operations than otherwise. Multi-Version permissiveness (mv-permissiveness) is a progress condition for multi-version STMs that states that a read-only transaction never aborts. Recently a STM system was proposed that maintains only a single version but is mv-permissive. This raises a natural question: how much concurrency can be achieved by multi-version STM. We show that fewer transactions are aborted in multi-version STMs than single-version systems. We also show that any STM system that is permissive w.r.t opacity must maintain at least as many versions as the number of live transactions. A direct implication of this result is that no single-version STM can be permissive w.r.t opacity.In this paper we present a time-stamp based multiversion STM system that satisfies opacity and is easy to implement. We formally prove the correctness of the proposed STM system. Although many multi-version STM systems have been proposed in literature that satisfy opacity, to the best of our knowledge none of them has been formally proved to be opaque. We also present garbage collection procedure which deletes unwanted versions of the transaction objects. We show that with garbage collection the number of versions maintained is bounded by number of live transactions."

It presents a generic protocol that proceeds by consecutive asynchronous rounds. Each round follows a two-phase pattern. The modularity and the versatility of the protocol appear at each phase of a round. The first phase is a selection phase that allows to use any combination merging random oracle, leader oracle and condition. Its aim is to ensure termination by allowing the processes to start the second phase with the same value. The aim of the second phase is to ensure that the agreement property cannot be violated. Its cost depends on the value of f: two communication steps when f < n/2, that reduce to a single communication step when f < n/3. Hence, the behavior of the first phase is mainly ruled by the system additional equipment, while the behavior of the second phase depends on the value of f. It follows that the proposed protocol can be instantiated in different ways according to the oracles the system is equipped with and the actual value of f."

While there is a wealth of experimental data regarding the molecular and cellular signals involved in the differentiation of CD4+ T cells in vitro, there is still no consensus regarding the structure of the network of interactions at the molecular and cellular levels controlling this differentiation process. In this work, a virtual culture of cells is constructed by interconnecting several instances of an updated version of the regulatory network controlling the differentiation process of CD4+ T cells in mice. The virtual culture is a multi-compartment model with an instance of a regulatory network inside each compartment, thus simulating a simplified version of a cell culture in a well-stirred reactor. The virtual culture is able to describe the stable molecular expression patterns described for fully differentiated CD4+ T cells in mice, as well as the differentiation process from a precursor to a given effector cell in response to specific molecular stimuli. © 2013 Society for Mathematical Biology."

The proposal is focused on real-world applications where a portrait image is printed and illegitimately used for commercial purposes. It is well known that this is one of the most difficult challenges to prove ownership through current watermark techniques. We propose an original approach which avoids the deficiencies of typical watermarking methods in practical scenarios by introducing a smart process to automatically detect the most suitable region of the portrait image, where the visible watermark goes unnoticed to the naked eye of a viewer and is robust enough to remain visible when printed. The position of the watermark is determined by performing an analysis of the portrait image characteristics taking into account several conditions of their spatial information together with human visual system properties. Once the location is set, the watermark embedding process is performed adaptively by creating a contrast effect between the watermark and its background. Several experiments are performed to illustrate the proper functioning of the proposed watermark algorithm on portrait images with different characteristics, including dimensions, backgrounds, illumination and texture, with the conclusion that it can be applied in many practical situations."

Still, many applications in artificial intelligence allow finite domains to work with, and this gives an opportunity to apply abduction in first order logic with restricted domains. In this paper, we present an approach to abductive reasoning in C-structures, first order structures with a finite domain in which each of its elements has a corresponding constant representing its interpretation.

This class of proteins usually binds at specific DNA sequences, activating or repressing gene expression. In general, TFs are composed of two domains: The DNA-binding domain (DBD) and an extra domain, which in this work we have named 'companion domain' (CD). This latter could be involved in one or more functions such as ligand binding, protein-protein interactions or even with enzymatic activity. In contrast to DBDs, which have been widely characterized both experimentally and bioinformatically, information on the abundance, distribution, variability and possible role of the CDs is scarce. Here, we investigated these issues associated with the domain architectures of TFs in prokaryotic genomes. To this end, 19 families of TFs in 761 non-redundant bacterial and archaeal genomes were evaluated. In this regard we found four main groups based on the abundance and distribution in the analyzed genomes: I) LysR and TetR/AcrR; ii) AraC/XylS, SinR, and others; iii) Lrp, Fis, ArsR, and others; and iv) a group that included only two families, ArgR and BirA. Based on a classification of the organisms according to the life-styles, a major abundance of regulatory families in free-living organisms, in contrast with pathogenic, extremophilic or intracellular organisms, was identified. Finally, the protein architecture diversity associated to the 19 families considering a weight score for domain promiscuity evidenced which regulatory families were characterized by either a large diversity of CDs, here named as 'promiscuous' families given the elevated number of variable domains found in those TFs, or a low diversity of CDs. Altogether this information helped us to understand the diversity and distribution of the 19 Prokaryotes TF families. Moreover, initial steps were taken to comprehend the variability of the extra domain in those TFs, which eventually might assist in evolutionary and functional studies. © 2018 Perez-Rueda et al.

This class of proteins usually binds at specific DNA sequences, activating or repressing gene expression. In general, TFs are composed of two domains: The DNA-binding domain (DBD) and an extra domain, which in this work we have named 'companion domain' (CD). This latter could be involved in one or more functions such as ligand binding, protein-protein interactions or even with enzymatic activity. In contrast to DBDs, which have been widely characterized both experimentally and bioinformatically, information on the abundance, distribution, variability and possible role of the CDs is scarce. Here, we investigated these issues associated with the domain architectures of TFs in prokaryotic genomes. To this end, 19 families of TFs in 761 non-redundant bacterial and archaeal genomes were evaluated. In this regard we found four main groups based on the abundance and distribution in the analyzed genomes: I) LysR and TetR/AcrR; ii) AraC/XylS, SinR, and others; iii) Lrp, Fis, ArsR, and others; and iv) a group that included only two families, ArgR and BirA.

The approach assumes a simple nonlinear model of the fluid in a pipeline with leaks, discretizing the spacial variable in nonuniform sections with unknown boundaries that depend on the leaks locations, z1 and z1+z2 . The key to the detection and location algorithm is the use of a multi-task scheme: (1) the continuous monitoring and searching of the leak condition, sweeping all feasible leak positions of the duct, and (2) when a leak condition is detected, the scheme switches on and starts the accommodation of the unknown parameters (z1,z2) in the model, so that, an error signal is minimized satisfying physical constraints. Simulation examples with one and two leaks are given to show the effectiveness of the location procedure."

After the evaluation of the two most commonly used fluorochromes, acridine orange (AO) and fluorescein diacetate (FDA) as metabolic indicator stains, AO gave ambiguous results and therefore FDA was chosen. The lower stability at room temperature and fast fluorescence intensity decay (50% after only 30 s of illumination in UV light) could be overcome by the use of a digital image acquisition system including frame grabber and a video camera. Fresh (live) fungal hyphae emitted a bright green fluorescence when stained with this dye (7.5 μg/L), whereas a total absence of fluorescence was observed when using sterilized (dead) fungal cells, Fresh cells were subjected to different lethal and sublethal treatments and the percentage of FDA stained fluorescent hyphae was then measured over the total hyphal area (% of FDA-stained area) by image analysis. At the same time, samples were cultivated in shake flasks in order to correlate this % of FDA-stained area with its growth rate, a functional indicator of viability. The linear correlation (r = 0.979) was: growth rate (g/L·h) = 2.25 × 10-3 (% of FDA-stained area). This method was used to evaluate the viability of the fungus under two different fermentation conditions in a 10-L bioreactor. Estimated viable biomass during fermentation was strongly influenced by the process conditions. The use of FDA, with computer-aided quantitative image analysis, has made it possible to rapidly and reliably quantify the viability of T. harzianum. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

In this work, a method that allows the accurate determination of embedded particles within dispersed elements was developed and validated.

However, almost all automatic work has been done in the constituent approach. Conversely, manual work is the traditional way for syntactic information acquisition in the dependency approach, which considers the correspondence between semantic valences and theirs syntactic realizations. The last approximation has some advantages for description of languages with relaxed word order constraints and a vast prepositional use. Our work is intended to compile automatically a government patterns dictionary in what syntactic information is referred to and to give a tool to facilitate linking of valences and meaning."

This transform is an image description model that incorporates important properties of visual perception, such as the Gaussian-derivative model of early vision. Based on this, the authors present a directional-sensitive technique that adapts the degree of noise reduction to the local contents of the image, i.e., to the presence of important image features and to the local noise statistics. The restored image is obtained by means of an inverse polynomial transform which consists of interpolating the transformed coefficients with pattern functions that are products of a polynomial and a window function. They show in this paper how the noise reduction task can be improved by detecting the position and orientation of relevant contours and considering the multiplicative nature of speckle in SAR images. This method is applied in a coarse-to-fine resolution approach, in which, contour location is not degraded even at the stage of high resolution processing."

Fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) are used to approximate the unknown dynamics. Based on the a priori information, a nominal control implemented by FLSs is designed first, then a signal to compensate for both structured and unstructured uncertainties arising from the approximation is synthesized based on the Lyapunov method. The uncertainty bounds needed in the robust fuzzy control are adaptively tuned online. Exponential tracking to the reference trajectory up to a ultimately bounded error is achieved."

In this sense, we optimized the parameters for the synthesis of different concentrations (6, 7, and 10 %) of poly-lactic acid (PLA) scaffolds by air jet spinning technology (AJS). The PLA scaffolds were characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis. Our results by SEM micrographs showed that scaffolds have a fibrilar morphology with nanoscale diameter of fibers. Biocompatibility assay was observed through an in vitro experiment based on cell attachment, MTT and cell-material interaction assay when culturing bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells onto the PLA spun membrane scaffolds. Our data indicate that fiber membrane of PLA scaffold increase the cellular response, are not cytotoxic when compared to thin films of PLA. Thus; the proposed synthesis method has potential for easy processing of spun fibrilar scaffolds with good biocompatibility and could be a promising economical biomaterial with future potential applications in tissue regeneration."

This model is inspired in biological insights and includes some important properties of human vision such as the Gaussian derivative model for early vision proposed by Young [The Gaussian derivative theory of spatial vision: analysis of cortical cell receptive field line-weighting profiles, General Motors Res. Labs. Rep. 4920, 1986]. The image transform that we propose in this work uses analysis operators similar to those of the Hermite transform at multiple scales, but the synthesis scheme of our approach integrates the responses of all channels at different scales. The advantages of this scheme are: (1) Both analysis and synthesis operators are Gaussian derivatives. This allows for simplicity during implementation. (2) The operator functions possess better space-frequency localization, and it is possible to separate adjacent scales one octave apart, according to Wilson's results on human vision channels. [H.R. Wilson, J.R. Bergen, A four mechanism model for spatial vision. Vision Res. 19 (1979) 19-32). (3) In the case of two-dimensional (2-D) signals, it is easy to analyze local orientations at different scales. A discrete approximation is also derived from an asymptotic relation between the Gaussian derivatives and the discrete binomial filters. We show in this work how the proposed transform can be applied to the problems of image coding, noise reduction and image fusion. Practical considerations are also of concern. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Since low-attenuation areas in HRCT images describe different emphysema patterns, the discrimination problem should focus on the characterization of both local intensities and global spatial variations. We propose a novel texture-based classification framework using complex Gabor filters and local binary patterns. We also analyzed a set of global and local texture descriptors to characterize emphysema morphology. The results have shown the effectiveness of our proposal and that the combination of descriptors provides robust features that lead to an improvement in the classification rate. © Springer-Verlag 2013."

One approach to quantify soil structure is to scan intact soil cores by X-ray computed tomography (CT), which allows using computer vision algorithms to identify internal components within the soil. One commonly used approach is the colour-based segmentation of CT-scan soil images into two regions – matter and void – for the purpose of determining the soil porosity. A key problem with this approach is that soil CT images tend to be rather complicated, and thus this type of bi-region segmentation is a non-trivial problem, with algorithms following this type of bi-region approach typically performing unreliability across a variety of image sets. In this work, a technique is proposed that identifies an optimal number of regions present in the soil, rather than just two. It is claimed that this more sophisticated representation of soil structure leads to a more accurate representation than traditional bi-region segmentation; however, it is reducible to a bi-region segmentation yielding the required estimation of porosity with more accuracy and robustness than traditional methods. It is also proposed that segmentation is performed using a multi-region kriging algorithm, which establishes relationships between distance and regions that allows the segmentation to overcome many of the artefacts and noise issues associated with CT scanning. Our experiments focused on layer-by-layer segmentation and results demonstrated that the proposed approach produced segmentations consistent across a variety of scanned cores and were visually more correct than current state-of-the-art bi-region techniques."

Evolution and action are involved in a consistent way in environment, while interaction of agents with the medium is constant. Based on a consolidated and active branch in the field of formal language theory, CGS are a highly formalized framework based in the postulates of artificial life that seems to be quite easy to implement, due to the simplicity of the formalism and the computational background of the theory they use.

Experiments allowed to analyze the effect of varying amounts of surfactant (mixture of proteins coming from the biomass and bovine serum albumin) and solid concentration (mycelial biomass) on gassed power input, mean drop and bubble size distributions. Experimental power input measurements showed that the different mixtures of biomass and protein, keeping constant the agitation rate, affected the gassed power consumption by approximately ±10%. By keeping the gassed power input fixed during the dispersion experiments, it was possible to rule out the effects of the power consumption variation and to discern and analyze the impact of the amount of protein and biomass on the dispersion of air bubbles and oil drops. The protein, due to its surface-active properties, caused a considerable decrease in the Sauter mean diameter of air bubbles compared to the system without protein, regardless of the concentration. Protein did not have an effect on oil drops, which maintained a constant Sauter diameter through the studied concentration range (0-1.36 g/L). It was shown that, for comparable biomass concentrations, the gassed power input is the parameter determining the Sauter diameter of air bubbles as well as for the oil drops.

Experiments allowed to analyze the effect of varying amounts of surfactant (mixture of proteins coming from the biomass and bovine serum albumin) and solid concentration (mycelial biomass) on gassed power input, mean drop and bubble size distributions. Experimental power input measurements showed that the different mixtures of biomass and protein, keeping constant the agitation rate, affected the gassed power consumption by approximately ±10%.

The protein, due to its surface-active properties, caused a considerable decrease in the Sauter mean diameter of air bubbles compared to the system without protein, regardless of the concentration.

Of the techniques reported in the literature, very few are fully automatic. In this paper, we present an efficient and accurate, fully automatic 3-D segmentation procedure for brain MR scans. It has several salient features; namely, the following. 1) Instead of a single multiplicative bias field that affects all tissue intensities, separate parametric smooth models are used for the intensity of each class. 2) A brain atlas is used in conjunction with a robust registration procedure to find a nonrigid transformation that maps the standard brain to the specimen to be segmented. This transformation is then used to: segment the brain from nonbrain tissue; compute prior probabilities for each class at each voxel location and find an appropriate automatic initialization. 3) Finally, a novel algorithm is presented which is a variant of the expectation-maximization procedure, that incorporates a fast and accurate way to find optimal segmentations, given the intensity models along with the spatial coherence assumption. Experimental results with both synthetic and real data are included, as well as comparisons of the performance of our algorithm with that of other published methods."

The color information of every pixel is integrated as a unit by an adaptive similarity function thus avoiding color information scattering. As a direct application we present an efficient interactive, supervised color segmentation method with linear complexity respect to the number of pixels of the input image. The process has three steps: (1) Manual selection of few pixels in a sample of the color to be segmented. (2) Automatic generation of the so called color similarity image (CSI), which is a gray level image with all the gray level tonalities associated with the selected color. (3) Automatic threshold of the CSI to obtain the final segmentation. The proposed technique is direct, simple and computationally inexpensive. The evaluation of the efficiency of the color segmentation method is presented showing good performance in all cases of study. A comparative study is made between the behavior of the proposed method and two comparable segmentation techniques in color images using (1) the Euclidean metric of the a* and b* color channels rejecting L* and (2) a probabilistic approach on a* and b* in the CIE L*a*b* color space. Our testing system can be used either to explore the behavior of a similarity function (or metric) in different color spaces or to explore different metrics (or similarity functions) in the same color space. It was obtained from the results that the color parameters a* and b* are not independent of the luminance parameter L* as one might initially assume in the CIE L*a*b* color space. We show that our solution improves the quality of the proposed color segmentation technique and its quick result is significant with respect to other solutions found in the literature. The method also gives a good performance in low chromaticity, gray level and low contrast images."

Columnists in newspapers, being also writers, follow their specific style. The style tends to be stable once writers reach maturity, but it is subject to change when internal or external circumstances differ. Here, we apply a bag-of-words approach to approximate the style of several journalists working in Mexican newspapers, and we track their style for a long period of time with the aim of detecting changes when external circumstances, in particular political ones, change. This provided us with an environment for detecting variations in stylomics, which is the closest we can get to an experiment. In particular, we collected hundreds of writings of ten Mexican columnists from different newspapers, both previous to the Presidential Mexican elections of 2018 and posterior to it. We processed these documents on different supervised and not supervised learning algorithms, such as random forest, principal component analysis, and k-means. Likewise, we implemented different validation procedures. As a result, we detected that the style in all studied columnists suffered tangible changes in the frequency of use of some particular words, particularly at specific times, some of which may be related to the 2018 Mexican presidential elections."

These data are frequently managed within data warehouses. However, the current data warehouse architectures based on n-ary-Relational DBMSs are overcoming their limits in order to efficiently manage such large amounts of data. Some DBMS are able to load huge amounts of data nevertheless; the response times become unacceptable for business users during information retrieval. In this paper we describe an alternative data warehouse reference architectural configuration (ADW) which addresses many issues that organisations are facing. The ADW approach considers a Binary-Relational DBMS as an underlying data repository. Therefore, a number of improvements have been achieved, such as data density increment, reduction of data sparsity, query response times dramatically decreased, and significant workload reduction with data loading, backup and restore tasks."

We show that utterance mood can be predicted from intonational information, and that this mood information can then be used to recognize the dialogue act."

In this sense, augmented reality (AR) technologies provide a new form of data representation by combining the common analysis using images and the ability to superimpose virtual 3D representations of the organs of the human body in the real environment. In this paper we describe the development of a generic computer platform based on augmented reality technology for surgical preoperative planning. In particular, the surgeon can navigate in the 3D models of the patient’s organs in order to have the possibility to perfectly understand the anatomy and plan in the best way the surgical procedure. In addition, a touchless interaction with the virtual organs is available thanks to the use of an armband provided of electromyographic muscle sensors. To validate the system, we focused in two cases of study: navigation through aorta artery for mitral valve repair surgery and navigation through vascular structures in the brain for the treatment of cerebral aneurysms. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."

Our algorithm is intended to provide segmented images preserving subtle details (i.e. streets) while showing a low incidence of isolated pixels and well-defined edges. The proposed method performs the segmentation task in three main stages: (a) a non-contextual segmentation stage by means of a maximum-likelihood classifier, based on a Bayesian model, (b) a segmentation stage, based on geometric properties for street detection, and (c) a contextual segmentation stage, based on Markov random fields theory. Results provided by the proposed segmentation scheme show a good estimation of streets and edges, as well as a low incidence of isolated pixels, resulting in a segmented image showing homogeneous regions and preservation of subtle details."

A minimal discrete knot is the digitalized representation of a knot, which is composed of the minimum number of constant orthogonal straight-line segments and is represented by the knot-number notation. The proposed algorithm for obtaining minimal discrete knots tries to reduce the number of straight-line segments of a given discrete knot preserving its shape. This algorithm is based on two fundamental transformations: U and L. In order to prove the efficiency and rapidity of the algorithm, a great variety of examples of discrete knots are presented: complete families of discrete knots at different orders; random discrete knots; examples of non-trivial and unsolved discrete knots. © World Scientific Publishing Company."

The work proposed here is based on the two previous works of the measure of discrete compactness [E. Bribiesca, Measuring 2-D shape compactness using the contact perimeter, Comput. Math. Appl. 33 (1997) 1–9; E. Bribiesca, A measure of compactness for 3D shapes, Comput. Math. Appl. 40 (2000) 1275–1284]. The measure of compactness proposed here improves and simplifies the previous measure of discrete compactness. Now, using this proposed measure of compactness, it is possible to compute measures for any kind of object including porous and fragmented objects. Also, the computation of the measures is very simple by means of the use of only one equation. The measure of compactness proposed here depends in large part on the sum of the contact perimeters of the side-connected pixels for 2D shapes or on the sum of the contact surface areas of the face-connected voxels for 3D shapes. Relations between the perimeter and the contact perimeter for 2D shapes and between the area of the surface enclosing the volume and the contact surface area, are presented.The measure presented here of compactness is invariant under translation, rotation, and scaling. In this work, the term of compactness does not refer to point-set topology, but is related to intrinsic properties of objects. Finally, in order to prove our measure of compactness, we calculate the measures of discrete compactness of different objects. Also, we present an important application for brain structures quantification by means of the use of the new proposed measure of discrete compactness."

Hence, this paper presents an efficient mapping strategy based on optimizing communications between processes as well as load balancing process distribution onto an arbitrary processor network. Such a mapping strategy is developed as a parallel program, based on the simultaneous execution of local, independent processes. This fact contrasts with many other approaches for solving the mapping problem, like simulated annealing, heuristic search, and others, which require a centralized control for the mapping. In this paper, it is shown that the present mapping strategy is efficient enough when applied to two different mapping problems.

We report an extended phenomenological investigation of sequence-space synesthesia in a single case (AB). We used the Elicitation Interview (EI) method to facilitate repeated exploration of AB's synesthetic experience. During an EI the subject's attention is selectively guided by the interviewer in order to reveal precise details about the experience. Detailed analysis of the resulting 9h of interview transcripts provided a comprehensive description of AB's synesthetic experience, including several novel observations. For example, we describe a specific spatial reference frame (a mental room) in which AB's concurrents occur, and which overlays his perception of the real world (the physical room). AB is able to switch his attention voluntarily between this mental room and the physical room. Exemplifying the EI method, some of our observations were previously unknown even to AB. For example, AB initially reported to experience concurrents following visual presentation, yet we determined that in the majority of cases the concurrent followed an internal verbalization of the inducer, indicating an auditory component to sequence-space synesthesia. This finding is congruent with typical rehearsal of inducer sequences during development, implicating cross-modal interactions between auditory and visual systems in the genesis of this synesthetic form. To our knowledge, this paper describes the first application of an EI to synesthesia, and the first systematic longitudinal investigation of the first-person experience of synesthesia since the re-emergence of interest in this topic in the 1980's. These descriptions move beyond rudimentary graphical or spatial representations of the synesthetic spatial form, thereby providing new targets for neurobehavioral analysis."

An outstanding challenge is to show that a behavior-based perspective can also address open questions related to the genetic system. Accordingly, we have recently applied this perspective to one of science’s most fascinating mysteries: the origins of the standard genetic code. We modeled horizontal transfer of cellular components in a population of protocells using an iterated learning approach and found that it can account for the emergence of several key properties of the standard code. Here we further investigated the diachronic emergence of artificial codes and discovered that the model’s most frequent sequence of amino acid assignments overlaps significantly with the predictions in the literature. Our explorations of the factors that favor early incorporation into an emerging artificial code revealed two aspects: an amino acid’s relative probability of horizontal transfer, and its relative ease of discriminability in chemical space."

Despite its possible advantages, the use of computer-assisted physiotherapy of patients with musculoskeletal injuries has received little attention. In this paper, we detailed the development and evaluation of a robotic-assisted rehabilitation system as a new methodology of assisted physiotherapy in orthopaedics. The proposal consists of an enhanced end-effector haptic interface mounted in a passive mechanism for allowing patients to perform upper-limb exercising and integrates virtual reality games conceived explicitly for assisting the treatment of the forearm after injuries at the wrist or elbow joints. The present methodology represents a new approach to assisted physiotherapy for strength and motion recovery of wrist pronation/supination and elbow flexion-extension movements. We design specific game scenarios enriched by proprioceptive and haptic force feedback in three training modes: passive, active, and assisted exercising. The system allows the therapist to tailor the difficulty level on the observed motion capacity of the patients and the kinesiology measurements provided by the system itself. We evaluated the system through the analysis of the muscular activity of two healthy subjects, showing that the system can assign significant working loads during typical physiotherapy treatment profiles. Subsequently, a group of ten patients undergoing manual orthopaedic rehabilitation of the forearm tested the system, under similar conditions at variable intensities. Patients tolerated changes in difficulty through the tests, and they expressed a favourable opinion of the system through the administered questionnaires, which indicates that the system was well accepted and that the proposed methodology was feasible for the case study for subsequently controlled trials. Finally, a predictive model of the performance score in the form of a linear combination of kinesiology observations was implemented in function of difficult training parameters, as a way of systematically individualising the training during the therapy, for subsequent studies. © 2018 Miguel A.

In particular, data-driven methodshave shown very promising results mainly because they can deal with uncertain data and the variability of models betterthan model-based methods. The main contribution of this work is an unsupervised approach to leak detection and locationin water distribution networks.  This approach is based on a zone division of the network, and it only requires data froma normal operation scenario of the pipe network.  The proposition combines a periodic transformation and a data vectorextension together with principal component analysis of leakdetection.  A reconstruction-based contribution index is usedfor determining the leak zone location.  The Hanoi distribution network is employed as the case study for illustrating thefeasibility of the proposal. Single leaks are emulated with varying outflow magnitudes at all nodes that represent less than2.5% of the total demand of the network and between 3% and 25% of the node’s demand. All leaks can be detected withinthe time interval of a day, and the average classification rate obtained is 85.28% by using only data from three pressuresensors."

The authors show that these recurrence relations provide a paradigm which unifies distributed algorithms like synchronizers and distributed schedulers under a common formalism. This paradigm provides a technique for studying the properties of these algorithms when they are used in networks where link delays are not necessarily equal. They use the paradigm to analyze the performance of these algorithms. In particular it is shown that the behavior of algorithms which can be described by the recurrence relations is periodic after a short transitory phase and that the rate of computation can be computed efficiently

Nonetheless little is known on this matter due the lack of instruments for precise mobility quantification and study design difficulties. Materials and methods We carried out a cohort-nested, case-control study with 126 individuals (42 cases, 42 intradomestic controls and 42 population controls) with the goal of describing human mobility patterns of recently Dengue virus-infected subjects, and comparing them with those of noninfected subjects living in an urban endemic locality. Mobility was quantified using a GPSdata logger registering way points at 60-second intervals for a minimum of 15 natural days. Results Although absolute displacement was highly biased towards the intradomestic and peridomestic areas, occasional displacements exceeding a 100-Km radius from the center of the studied locality were recorded for all three study groups and individual displacements were recorded traveling across six states from central Mexico. Additionally, cases had a larger number of visits out of the municipality's administrative limits when compared to intradomestic controls (cases: 10.4 versus intradomestic controls: 2.9, p = 0.0282). We were able to identify extradomestic places within and out of the locality that were independently visited by apparently non-related infected subjects, consistent with houses, working and leisure places. Conclusions Results of this study show that human mobility in a small urban setting exceeded that considered by local health authority's administrative limits, and was different between recently infected and non-infected subjects living in the same household. These observations provide important insights about the role that human mobility may have in Dengue virus transmission and persistence across endemic geographic areas that need to be taken into account when planning preventive and control measures. Finally, these results are a valuable reference when setting the parameters for future mathematical modeling studies."

Therefore, we have carried out an evaluation of data matching considering Soundex Daitch-Mokotoff [1], Fuzzy Soundex [2] and Modified Soundex [3] in terms of precision-recall and f-measure. As far as we know such comparison against these encoding functions has not been presented before in such terms. The Daitch Mokotoff Soundex function has a better performance during string comparison. However, its execution time is greater than Fuzzy Soundex and Modified Soundex. This is justificable since the Daitch-Mokotoff Soundex algorithm is more complex and meticulous."

Transmission power control (TPC) is one of the various obfuscation techniques mentioned in the literature with the potential to provide location privacy to wireless users. This technique consists of letting the user vary the mobile node’s transmission power in a way that only the nearest eavesdropper can overhear the mobile node’s signals. This variation reduces the number of eavesdroppers overhearing the mobile node’s transmissions, thus increasing the location error estimated by nearby eavesdroppers, thereby improving the mobile user’s location privacy. Although some works have highlighted the advantages of TPC as a location privacy technique, no previous work has studied its effectiveness considering wireless channel impairments, hardware limitations, and localization algorithms used by eavesdroppers. This paper analyzes the real value of using TPC as a location privacy technique through a probabilistic model that measures the ability of TPC to effectively reduce the number of overhearing eavesdroppers. The results presented in this work show that the effectiveness of TPC is considerably affected by wireless channel impairments as well as by eavesdroppers’ density. Moreover, since off-the-shelf 802.11 radios have limited transmission power levels, real test-bed experiments showed that mobile users cannot always adjust their transmission power to fulfill the required levels of TPC. This is particularly the case in densely deployed scenarios in which most of the time the required transmission power is below the radio’s minimum transmission level. These results demonstrate the limited location privacy capabilities of TPC in most real-life scenarios, thus disproving previous claims that place TPC as a solution for the location privacy problem."

In particular, we focus on the probability of being able to convey messages from a source vehicle to a destination vehicle, which may be multiple hops away. This analysis takes into account the variability of the channel and how it affects the network connectivity of a linear VANET. In our model, the communication range of each vehicle is modeled as a random variable due to channel fading. The analytical results are used to study the effect of parameters like path loss exponent and vehicle density on the network connectivity probability. This facility is particularly useful for distributing traffic information related to road safety, weather, and navigation without the need for expensive infrastructure."

The system provides all the necessary hardware for a closed-loop sensorimotor neural interface. The system integrates a neural signal analyzer, two neural stimulators with different specifications, multiple body area sensory devices and a user-friendly computer interface. The neural signal analyzer features four channel analog frontend with configurable bandpass filter, gain stage, digitization resolution, and sampling rate. Digital filtering, neural feature extraction, spike detection, sensing-stimulating modulation, and compressed sensing measurement are realized in a central processing unit integrated in the analyzer. Flash memory card is activated for low power operation, compressed sensing recovery verification and/or data backup. An 8-channel stimulator with high driving capability (±10 mA with compliance voltage ±22V), and a 2-channel stimulator for deep brain stimulation are included in the proposed system. Both stimulators are capable of delivering bipolar, biphasic capacitive coupled current pulses in programmable pulse shape, amplitude, width, pulse train frequency and latency. Multi-functional wireless sensor node, including an accelerometer, a temperature sensor, and a general sensor extension port has been designed. Surveillance camera is implemented for the monitoring of the animals behavior. A userfriendly computer interface is designed to monitor, control and configure all aforementioned devices via wireless link. Wireless closed-loop operation between the sensory devices, neural stimulators, and neural signal analyzer can be configured. Bench test and in vivo experiments are performed to verify the functions and performance of the system."

11185,Application of a stereoscopic vision system for the accurate measure of air bubbles density trapped in oil drops in a model fermentation system,2005,Enrique Galindo,Instituto de Biotecnología (IBt),,,,,,TC,Engineering; Physics; Computer Simulation,,"Complex mixing processes require the dispersion of up to four phases. Particularly in bioprocesses, mass transfer usually determines the overall productivity. Mass transfer is associated to the size of air bubbles and oil drops and their particular distribution in the system. In a model system simulating the conditions of a fermentation process for the production of aroma compounds, we have studied the dispersion of air (gaseous phase), oil (immiscible liquid phase) and solid phase (microorganism of complex morphology) by an advanced image-analysis technique. This technique allowed us to visualize more clearly the highly complex interactions of the liquid and gaseous phases in the mixing tank. It has also been observed that some of the air bubbles and aqueous phase droplets remain trapped in the organic phase. Furthermore, the presence of biosurfactants such as a soluble protein increased considerably the formation of these complex oil structures, which are likely to be a multiple dispersion. By the acquisition and analysis of stereoscopic images of oil drops and air bubbles, we were able to measure the relative depth of each particle or discard the inclusions into drops in order to discern accurately if the air bubbles and water droplets were trapped in the oil drops or there was only a superposition of particles in different focal planes. In this work we report the accurate measurement of the density of bubbles trapped in the oil drops as a function of the concentration of soluble protein (bovine serum albumin) using the stereoscopic vision system. A detailed evaluation of the interactions between the phases would allow to clarify the mechanism by which air bubbles and water droplets are trapped or introduced into oil drops. This will contribute to understand how the different physicochemical conditions affect the mass transfer and the productivity of the process."

The traditional Hurst exponent methods usually analyze time series as a whole, providing a single value that characterizes their global behavior. In contrast, the methods based on the Local Hurst Exponent allow the evaluation of the fractal structure of a time series on local events. However, a critical parameter in these methods is the selection of scale. Here, a TS-LHE method is presented, based on a systematic implementation of the rescaled-range (R/S) method, in a set of sliding windows of different sizes. This method allows calculating instantaneous values of Local Hurst Exponents at different scales, associating them with individual samples of a time series. This paper is organized as follows: first, an overview of the TS-LHE is provided; then, a proof-of-concept of this analysis is presented, considering (a) different fractional Brownian motion series, (b) a synthetic seismic signal under different noise conditions, and (c) a group of real seismic traces. Finally, the obtained results show that the TS-LHE analysis is particularly sensitive to sudden behavior changes of the time series, such as frequency or phase variations. This sensitivity is independent of the amplitude of the data, and thus, it can be used to identify pattern changes as well as long- and short-range correlations within a time series."

The proper interpretation of an astronomical image, requires to obtain relevant information from the structures contained in it. This procedure requires to process the data locally. For our applications, it is required that the image data, which are given as an array of intensity values, be interpreted into meaningful patterns. For this purpose, we use the Hermite transform. This transform is an image representation model that analyzes an image by locally expanding it into a weighted sum of orthogonal polynomials. The applications that we propose are developed on pyramidal structures. Their purpose is to analyze optical astronomical images at different spatial scales."

This methodology is known as correlation analysis and the most common example is the least square correlation. In hydraulic engineering dimensionless parameters are obtained through dimensional analysis, based on the Buckingham theorem, which represent arbitrary concepts, which do not necessarily match the natural phenomena under study. If the dimensionless magnitudes that are intended to correlate share one or more common variables, a correlation that turns out to be fictitious can occur which is known as spurious correlation. The introduction of one or more common variables in the proposed correlation can lead to a deceivingly high value of the coefficient of correlation, ρ, erroneously concluding that the considered dimensionless magnitudes are truly causally related, when in truth it is a variable that correlates with itself. A statistical methodology is presented to detect and evaluate the degree of spuriousness between the proposed dimensionless magnitudes and thus accept or reject the proposed correlation. © 2020 International Symposium on Hydraulic Structures - XXII Congreso Latinoamericano de Hidraulica.

Herein we describe how molecular computing can be applied to detect activated hepatic stellate cells (HSC) -which are well known as the main responsible of hepatic fibrogenesis- and, as a response to positive diagnosis, express a gene (PPARγ1) which have been proved to reverse the myofibroblast-like phenotype of the HSC in vivo. We also propose a transport method to deliver the DNA computer into the HSC; namely, vitamin A-coupled liposomes."

We illustrate this approach by applying it to a minimalist case study in swarm robotics loosely inspired by ant foraging behavior. For simplicity, we measured a network’s inter-agent connection weights as the total number of interactions between mobile agents. This measure allowed us to construct weighted directed networks from the simulation results. We then applied standard methods from social network analysis, specifically focusing on node centralities, to find out which are the most influential nodes in the network. This revealed that task allocation emerges and induces two classes of agents, namely foragers and loafers, and that their relative frequency depends on food availability. This finding is consistent with the behavioral analysis, thereby showing the compatibility of these two approaches."

During its foraging behavior the cell spans spatially distributed sources of nutrients with a protoplasmic network. The geometrical structure of the protoplasmic networks allows the plasmodium to optimize transport of nutrients between remote parts of its body. Assuming major Mexican cities are sources of nutrients that need to be distributed across Mexico, how much does the structure of the Physarum protoplasmic network correspond to the structure of Mexican Federal highway network? To address the issue we undertook a series of laboratory experiments with living P. polycephalum. We represent geographical locations of major cities (19 locations) by oat flakes, place a piece of plasmodium in the area corresponding to Mexico city, record the plasmodium's foraging behavior and extract topology of the resulting nutrient transport networks. Results of our experiments show that the protoplasmic network formed by Physarum is isomorphic, subject to limitations imposed, to a network of principal highways. Ideas and results in the paper may contribute towards future developments in bio-inspired road planning."

This model (strong relaxation) was shown to be proper in the sense that the minimum cost for the relaxed problem coincides with the infimum cost for the original one, and it solves some of the difficulties encountered when another procedure, based on a well-known technique for reducing a control system of this nature to a delay-free problem, is used. However, the proof of its being proper is unsatisfactory in two respects, not only from a theoretical point of view but also in order to construct numerical approximation algorithms. In this proof the use of the reduced-problem technique is still needed, so that the disadvantages of this procedure remain present. Moreover, the existence of a sequence of ordinary delayed controls which converges to a given strongly relaxed control is assured, but one may fail to exhibit it. In this paper we solve these questions by giving an explicit methodology, which is independent of the reduced-problem technique, for constructing such a sequence. Also, this constructive approach provides a new and simple proof of the fact that the space of strongly relaxed controls coincides with the weak-star closure of the space of ordinary delayed controls."

We argue that whenever Turing instabilities of neural activity play a role in generating visual hallucinations, they do more than shape the geometric patterns. Their relatively autonomous self-organization is a source of intrinsic value related to their self-maintenance as a pattern of activity, and they would also thereby decouple ""higher-level"" stages of neural processing from external stimulation, thus facilitating a more abstract mode of cognition. These additional features of our proposal support Hodgson and Lewis-Williams in their respective theories about the very first origins of human artistic activity. We also evaluate the critical literature regarding the possibility of ritualized enaction of altered states of consciousness (ASC) in early prehistory. We conclude that ASC were indeed possible, and suggest that they were likely involved in facilitating the social development of more symbolic forms of life and mind."

SUMMARY ANSWER: The results reveal statistically significant [Ca2+]i oscillations that are correlated with the human sperm flagellar beating frequency, when measured in three-dimensions (3D). WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Fast [Ca2+]i oscillations that are correlated to the beating flagellar frequency of cells swimming in a restricted volume have been detected in hamster sperm. To date, such findings have not been confirmed in any other mammalian sperm species. An important question that has remained regarding these observations is whether the fast [Ca2+]i oscillations are real or might they be due to remaining defocusing effects of the Z component arising from the 3D beating of the flagella. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Healthy donors whose semen samples fulfill theWHO criteria between the age of 18-28 were selected. Cells from at least six different donors were utilized for analysis. Approximately the same number of experimental and control cells were analyzed. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Motile cells were obtained by the swim-up technique and were loaded with Fluo-4 (Ca2+ sensitive dye) or with Calcein (Ca2+ insensitive dye). Ni2+ was used as a non-specific plasma membrane Ca2+ channel blocker. Fluorescence data and flagella position were acquired in 3D. Each cell was recorded for up to 5.6 s within a depth of 16 microns with a high speed camera (coupled to an image intensifier) acquiring at a rate of 3000 frames per second, while an oscillating objective vibrated at 90 Hz via a piezoelectric device. From these samples, eight experimental and nine control sperm cells were analyzed in both 2D and 3D. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: We have implemented a new system that allows [Ca2+]i measurements of the human sperm flagellum beating in 3D. These measurements reveal statistically significant [Ca2+]i oscillations that correlate with the flagellar beating frequency. These oscillations may arise from intracellular sources and/or Ca2+ transporters, as they were insensitive to external Ni2+, a nonspecific plasma membrane Ca2+ channel blocker. LARGE SCALE DATA: N/A. LIMITATIONS REASONS FOR CAUTION: Analysis in 3D needs a very fast image acquisition rate to correctly sample a volume containing swimming sperm. This condition requires a very short exposure time per image making it necessary to use an image intensifier which also increases noise. The lengthy analysis time required to obtain reliable results limited the number of cells that could be analyzed. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The possibility of recording flagellar [Ca2+]i oscillations described here may open a new avenue to better understand ciliary and flagellar beating that are fundamental for mucociliary clearance, oocyte transport, fertilization, cerebrospinal fluid pressure regulation and developmental left-right symmetry breaking in the embryonic node.

The only direct information available from this method is the time of flight (TOF) measurement. A 2D target position can be represented as a linear equation system when the bearing is measured by an array of sensors located on a line. To calculate the 3D position of targets a nonlinear equation system has to be solved. The solution of this system can be done by several numerical methods, mainly iterative processes. In this paper the solution is given by representing a non-linear system as a linear system using the Taylor expansion series. This approximate solution restricts the array geometry where no singularities appear in the solution. The proposed 2D array geometry, given by the approximate solution and the characteristics of the capacitive transducer built at Nottingham University, in conjunction with a composite algorithm of envelope beam-forming technique and Taylor expansion series algorithm, are used as to model a 3D ranging system. The results of 3D position of multiple targets are within the expected values given by range and angular resolutions of the ultrasonic system."

It is essential to localize and characterize potential flow paths and to estimate the amount of water leakages, so that appropriate sealing works can be performed. Estimating the amount of water ingress is a multi-phase process starting from qualitative and quantitative examination of rock mass. Due to association of uncertainty, vagueness and incompleteness with the monitored data set, particularly resulted from the in situ tests, accounting relevant approaches such Fuzzy Logic and Recurrent Neural Networks, are proposed in this research for learning acquisition, extraction of rules and prediction of behaviors. The computational set of artificial tools permits using the complex information entities or information granules (rock types, geologic structures, hydro-fracture potential) for data abstraction and derivation of knowledge from records (numerical or linguistic format). This is more a theoretical perspective than a set of methods or principles. As a theoretical perspective, this proposal encourages an approach to data that recognizes and exploits the information present in indexes at various levels of resolution or scales. In this sense, it encompasses the methods which provide flexibility and adaptability in the resolution at which knowledge or information is extracted and represented. The product of merging these tools is a 3D artificial-mapping of rock classification (Qi-system), geological conditions and Lugeon units that permits, as far as possible, to understand more and better the flow behavior. © 2015 by the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy & Petroleum and ISRM."

While I share Franchi’s interpretation, I disagree that this theory of life is a promising alternative that is at odds with most of the Western philosophical tradition. On the contrary, heteronomy lies at the very core of computationalism, and this is precisely what explains its persistent failure to construct life-like agents."

The technique was applied to evaluation of the development and severity of anthracnose of mango fruit, caused by the fungus Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. In this method, a stepper motor rotates the mango fruit along its longitudinal axis while acquiring a sequence of 360 images of its total surface (one image for each degree). This set of images is used to create a pseudocylindrical 'equal-area' projection of the fruit in a two-dimensional map containing complete morphometrical and photometrical information of its surface. The lesion area can easily be evaluated from this map with image-analysis procedures. Quantitative data (percentage of area affected) can be used to establish an assessment scale for the disease based on lesion spots measured, as well as for detailed laboratory studies of mango anthracnose development.

This paper establishes a direct correlation between distributed agreement problems and error-correcting codes. In particular, crash failures in distributed agreement problems correspond to erasure failures in error-correcting codes and Byzantine and value domain faults correspond to corruption errors. This correlation is exemplified by concentrating on two well-known agreement problems, namely, consensus and interactive consistency, in the context of the condition-based approach. Specifically, the paper presents the following results: First, it shows that the conditions that allow interactive consistency to be solved despite f(c) crashes and f(e) value domain faults correspond exactly to the set of error- correcting codes capable of recovering from f(c) erasures and f(e) corruptions. Second, the paper proves that consensus can be solved despite f(c) crash failures iff the condition corresponds to a code whose Hamming distance is f(c) + 1 and Byzantine consensus can be solved despite f(b) Byzantine faults iff the Hamming distance of the code is 2f(b) + 1. Finally, the paper uses the above relations to establish several results in distributed agreement that are derived from known results in error-correcting codes and vice versa."

If an agent’s preference is not in conflict with the preferences of the other agents, then this preference can be grabbed by the agent.

However, it is a time-consuming task since experts are required to recognize each pollen grain through the microscope. In this study, we performed an exhaustive assessment on the utility of texture analysis for automated characterisation of pollen samples. A database composed of 1800 brightfield microscopy images of pollen grains from 15 different taxa was used for this purpose. A pattern recognition-based methodology was adopted to perform pollen classification. Four different methods were evaluated for texture feature extraction from the pollen image: Haralick's gray-level co-occurrence matrices (GLCM), log-Gabor filters (LGF), local binary patterns (LBP) and discrete Tchebichef moments (DTM). Fisher's discriminant analysis and k-nearest neighbour were subsequently applied to perform dimensionality reduction and multivariate classification, respectively. Our results reveal that LGF and DTM, which are based on the spectral properties of the image, outperformed GLCM and LBP in the proposed classification problem. Furthermore, we found that the combination of all the texture features resulted in the highest performance, yielding an accuracy of 95%. Therefore, thorough texture characterisation could be considered in further implementations of automatic pollen recognition systems based on image processing techniques. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd."

Monitoring of the progress of the resection has shown to be a necessary feature of an effective robotic system for prostate surgery. It should provide the surgeon with a reliable method of assessing the cavity during resection. An automatic system for intraoperative monitoring of the progress of the resection during robotic prostatectomy consists of two subsystems: real-time intraoperative imaging of the prostate and automatic identification of the contour of the gland on each image. The development of a fully automatic scheme for prostate recognition on transurethral ultrasound scans is reported. A genetic algorithm has been developed to automatically adjust a model of the prostate boundary until an optimum fit to the prostate in a given image is obtained. An analysis of its performance on 22 different ultrasound images showed an average error of 6.21 mm. Use of a genetic algorithm and a constrained prostate model have shown to be a robust way to automatically identify the prostate in ultrasound images. The scheme is able to produce approximate prostate boundaries, without any human intervention, on ultrasound scans of varying quality. In addition to soft tissue robotic surgery, the genetic algorithm technique is also applicable to a wide range of computer assisted surgical techniques."

We developed and tested a method to automatically identify arterial/venular (A/V) vessels in digital retinal images in conjunction with a semi-automatic segmentation technique. Methods of segmentation of blood vessels and the optic disc (OD) was performed as previously described, using a dataset of 10 colour fundus images. Using the OD as a reference a graph representation was constructed using the vessel skeletons. Vessel bifurcations and crossings were identified based on direction and local geometry, and A/V classification was carried out by fuzzy logic classification using colour information. Results were compared with expert classification. Preliminary results showed an average true positive rate for arteries of TPRA=0.83 and TPRV=0.74 for veins. With an overall average of TPRall=0.79 for both vessel type jointly. Computer-based systems can assess local and global aspects of the retinal microvascular architecture, geometry and topology. Automated A/V classification will facilitate efficient cost-effective assessment of clinical images at scale."

During that time we have focused on search engine dictionary improvement, but recently our aim has been a development methodology for creating specialized onomasiological dictionaries in a semi-automatic way. To automate the creation of onomasiological dictionaries necessarily implies the automatic execution of used processes to populate the dictionaries knowledge base. Due to the nature of these dictionaries, the definitions that must be included in the knowledge base are both normative and colloquial. In this paper we present a proposal for semi-automatically populating the knowledge base of these dictionaries. "

Our work takes advantage of several features of social networks, particularly their availability and confidence they offer users in terms of reflecting their emotions. The corpus of tweets was manually marked with emotions. The corpus was balanced because it had 3,000 tweets for each of Ekman's negative emotions and for neutral tweets (15,000 tweets in total). The objective of the present study was to apply automatic learning in two (sad versus neutral tweets) or five (tweets with emotions distinguished) categories. Different features were evaluated by changing types of elements (words or lemmas), sizes (uni-, bi-, tri-, unibi-, unibitrigrams, among others), and values (term frequency or term frequency-inverse document frequency). Sadness was detected with an F1 = 0.962. The F1 for all neutral tweets and those with negative emotions was relatively high (0.664) because the task itself was difficult (random baseline = 0.2 for five categories). The present results were obtained from experiments conducted on the balanced textual corpus for the first time and were better than the state-of-The-Art methods. © 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2018."

The goals are to segment the fetal head and to measure the biparietal diameter (BPD) and head circumference (HC) using ultrasound images. By incorporating texture maps, morphological operations and active contours together with optimal ellipse detection, the segmentation and measurement of the fetal skull was performed. The results’ quality was evaluated by two obstetrician experts. A set of 10 studies was used to validate the segmentation process, obtaining a precision of 94.61%, a Dice similarity index of 97.19% and a maximum distance of 2.64 mm. To evaluate the head measures, a set of 23 images was used. The differences between experts and the proposed method are 2.72 mm for BPD and 2.73 mm for HC, with a correlation of 99.8% in both cases. These results suggest that the proposed method is suitable to be used for clinical applications in maternal medicine. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015"

A wide variety of sources have been successfully segmented by the traditional fuzzy segmentation algorithm on several different applications. However, the traditional approach of the fuzzy segmentation algorithm usually does not work well when dealing with objects whose materials are characterized by complex textures that cannot be accurately represented by simple fuzzy affinity functions of the traditional fuzzy segmentation algorithm. In this paper, we extend the fuzzy segmentation algorithm to use adaptive textural affinity functions for segmenting these objects in 2D images. These adaptive affinity functions define their optimal appropriate neighborhood size on execution time, by computing texture descriptors surrounding the seed spells, according to the characteristics of the texture being processed. The algorithm then segments the image with the appropriate neighborhood that may be different for each object. We performed experiments on mosaic images that were composed using images from the Brodatz database, and compared our results with the ones produced by a recently published texture segmentation algorithm, showing the applicability of our method."

The project is based on technical knowledge gained in previous space experiences, particularly in developing GASCAN automatic experiments for NASA's space shuttle, and in some support obtained from the local team which assembled the Mexico-OSCAR-30 microsatellites. Satex includes three autonomous payloads and a power subsystem, each one with a local microcomputer to provide intelligent and dedicated control. It also contains a flight computer (FC) with a pair of full redundancies. This enables the remote maintenance of processing boards from the ground station. A fourth communications payload depends on the flight computer for control purposes. A fifth payload was decided to be developed for the satellite. It adds value to the available on-board computers and extends the opportunity for a developing country to learn and to generate domestic space technology. Its aim is to provide automatic maintenance capabilities for the most critical on-board computer in order to achieve continuous satellite operations. This paper presents the virtual computer architecture specially developed to provide maintenance capabilities to the flight computer. The architecture is periodically implemented by software with a small amount of physical processors (FC processors) and virtual redundancies (payload processors) to emulate a hybrid redundancy computer. Communications among processors are accomplished over a fault-tolerant LAN. This allows a versatile operating behavior in terms of data communication as well as in terms of distributed fault tolerance. Obtained results, payload validation and reliability results are also presented. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

The use of three dimensional ultrasound (3D US) is preferred over other tomographic modalities such as CT or MRI, due to its inherent safety and availability. However, the image quality of 3D US is not as good as MRI and therefore there is little work on the automatic segmentation of anatomic structures in 3D US of fetal brains. In this work we present preliminary results of the development of a 3D Point Distribution Model (PDM), for automatic segmentation, of the cerebellum in 3D US of the fetal brain. The model is adjusted to a fetal 3D ultrasound, using a genetic algorithm which optimizes a model fitting function. Preliminary results show that the approach reported is able to automatically segment the cerebellum in 3D ultrasounds of fetal brains."

In this way, our method reliably estimates a relevance measure for predicting summary candidature scores, regardless topics in unseen documents. Our output summaries are comparable to the state-of-the-art. Thus we show that in order to extract meaning summaries, it is not crucial what is being said; but rather how it is being said."

Indulgent consensus algorithms exist for realistic eventually partially synchronous models, that never violate safety and guarantee liveness once the system becomes synchronous. Unavoidably, these algorithms may never terminate, even when no processor crashes, if the system never becomes synchronous. This paper proposes a mechanism similar to state machine replication, called RC-simulation, that can always make progress, even if the system is never synchronous. Using RC-simulation, the quality of the service will adjust to the current level of asynchrony of the network — degrading when the system is very asynchronous, and improving when the system becomes more synchronous. RC-simulation generalizes the state machine approach in the following sense: when the system is asynchronous, the system behaves as if k + 1 threads were running concurrently, where k is a function of the asynchrony. In order to illustrate how the RC-simulation can be used, we describe a long-lived renaming implementation. By reducing the concurrency down to the asynchrony of the system, RC-simulation enables to obtain renaming quality that adapts linearly to the asynchrony."

This was carried out as a result of the meeting held between several institutions from the Iberian Peninsula and EEUU (see Vilanova Marine Science/Robotics Meeting 2010). The experiment was to launch several AUVs at the same time in different zones of the Mediterranean and Mar Menor lagoon. AUVs took salinity data trying to do a coordinated mission during two operative days (November 3 and November 5). Others days of the experiment were used to the vehicles preparation and error correction (November 2 and November 4). This paper presents the steps followed in preparation and operative days with the set of AUVs. This paper presents also the salinity results obtained during these missions.

Spanish and Nahuatl are distant languages spoken in the same country. Due to the scarcity of digital resources, we describe the several problems that arose when compiling this corpus: most of our sources were non-digital books, we faced errors when digitizing the sources and there were difficulties in the sentence alignment process, just to mention some. The documents of the parallel corpus are not homogeneous, they were extracted from different sources, there is dialectal, diachronical, and orthographical variation. Additionally, we present a web search interface that allows to make queries through the whole parallel corpus, the system is capable to retrieve the parallel fragments that contain a word or phrase searched by a user in any of the languages. To our knowledge, this is the first Spanish-Nahuatl public available digital parallel corpus. We think that this resource can be useful to develop language technologies and linguistic studies for this language pair."

Recent work has addressed two issues. First, how can networks of neurons robustly hold such an active memory? Computer systems obtain significant robustness to noise by approximating analogue quantities with discrete digital representations. In a similar manner, theoretical models of persistent activity in spiking neurons have shown that the most robust and stable way to store the short-term memory of a continuous parameter is to approximate it with a discrete representation. This general idea applies very broadly to mechanisms that range from biochemical networks to single cells and to large circuits of neurons. Second, why is it commonly observed that persistent activity in the cortex can be strongly time-varying? This observation is almost ubiquitous, and therefore must be taken into account in our models and our understanding of how short-term memories are held in the cortex."

The Naive Bayes classifier in particular has shown itself to be a robust, computationally efficient and transparent approximation. However, due to its strong assumption of feature independence it is often too easily discarded. Understanding under what circumstances feature correlations are likely to occur and how to diagnose them is an important first step in improving the Naive Bayes approximation. Furthermore, combining features can lead to enhanced approximations. In this paper we show the benefits of a Generalised Bayes Approximation that accounts for feature correlations while, at the same time, showing that an important area where feature correlations are ubiquitous is in time series that represent aspects of human behaviour. Using data that represent historical patterns of exercise we show how more predictive and more insightful models for obesity can be constructed using a Generalised Bayes approximation that combines historical features, thereby capturing the idea of human habits. In particular, by analysing feature combinations we show that abandoning good past exercise habits is more correlated with obesity than never having had them in the first place."

The formalism allows for the integration of both biotic and abiotic factors of arbitrary resolution.

In this book Colombetti draws on the enactive theory of organismic embodiment and its key concept of sense-making in order to critically evaluate various aspects of mainstream affective science, including basic emotions and alternative constructionist approaches, as well as the cognitivist approach to emotion and appraisal theory. She defends and develops a dynamical systems approach to emotions and emphasizes the need for including more first-person methods of consciousness science in mainstream affective neuroscience. These are valuable contributions to affective science, and they also advance enactive theory. Colombetti's proposal goes further than standard neurophenomenology in that she appeals to the bodily basis of feeling, thereby requiring a new sort of neuro-physiophenomenology. Even more radically, she allows that all living beings are essentially affective beings, even those without a nervous system, and that emotional forms could be co-constituted by more than one person.

The involvement of N-glycoproteins, glycolipids, and cholesterol in rotavirus infection suggests that the virus receptor(s) might be forming part of lipid microdomains in the cell membrane. MA104 cells incubated with the nonionic detergent octyl-β-glucoside (OG) showed a ca. 60% reduction in their ability to bind rotaviruses, the same degree to which they became refractory to infection, suggesting that OG extracts the potential virus receptor(s) from the cell surface. Accordingly, when preincubated with the viruses, the OG extract inhibited the virus infectivity by more than 95%. This inhibition was abolished when the extract was treated with either proteases or heat but not when it was treated with neuraminidase, indicating the protein nature of the inhibitor. Two protein fractions of around 57 and 75 kDa were isolated from the extract, and these fractions were shown to have rotavirus-blocking activity. Also, antibodies to these fractions efficiently inhibited the infectivity of the viruses in untreated as well as in neuraminidase-treated cells. Five individual protein bands of 30, 45, 57, 75, and 110 kDa, which exhibited virus-blocking activity, were finally isolated from the OG extract. These proteins are good candidates to function as rotavirus receptors."

Here we generalize such results into a model for biological concept formation which can interact with heterogeneous agents through constraint-based reasoning. Our model includes linguistic agents, probabilistic agents for mining nucleic acid, and illness diagnosis agents. Information is selected automatically as a side effect of (the system) searching through applicable CHR rules, and automatically transformed when a rule triggers; decisions follow from the normal operation of the rules, and cognitive structure is given by properties that the concepts a given rule is trying to relate must satisfy. Moreover the user can declare under what circumstances a given property or properties can be relaxed. Concepts formed under relaxed properties result in output which signals not only what concepts were formed, but which of the properties associated with the construction of those concepts were satisfied and which were not. This allows us human-like flexibility while maintaining direct executability."

The processors are identically programmed but have distinct identities, taken from {0, 1,… ,M − 1}. We investigate the communication costs of three well studied tasks: Consensus, Leader, and MaxF (finding the maximum identity). We show that in chain and ring topologies, the message complexities of all three tasks are the same. Hence, we study a finer measure of complexity: the number of transmitted bits required to solve a task T, denoted BitC(T). We prove several new lower bounds (and some simple upper bounds) that imply the following results: For the two processors case, BitC(Consensus) = 2 and BitC(Leader) = BitC(MaxF) = 2log2 M ± O(1), where the gap between the lower and upper bounds is almost always 1. For a chain, BitC(Consensus) = Θ(n), BitC(Leader) = Θ(n + log M), and BitC(MaxF) = Θ(n log M). For the ring topology, we prove the lower bound of Ω(n log M) for Leader, and (hence) MaxF. We consider also a chain where the intermediate processors have no identities. We prove that BitC(Leader) = Θ(n log M), which is equal to n times the bit complexity of the problem for two processors. For the specific case when the chain length is even, we prove that BitC(Leader) = Θ(n), for both above settings. In addition, we show that for any algorithm solving MaxF, there exists an input, for which every execution has the bit complexity Ω(n log M) (this is not the case for Leader). In our proofs, we use both methods of distributed computing and of communication complexity theory, establishing new links between the two areas."

Nevertheless, recently a positive result was shown that such a system either wait-free or obstruction-free can solve an interesting one-shot task. This paper demonstrates another such result. It shows that (n − 1)-set agreement can be solved obstruction-free with merely 2 MWMR registers. Achieving k-set agreement with n − k + 1 registers is a challenge. We make the first step toward it by showing k-set agreement with 2(n − k) registers."

It consists of combining information originated from several sources in order to improve the decision making process. In particular, multi-focus image fusion combines images that depict the same scene but they are not in-focus everywhere. The task seeks to reconstruct an image as sharp as possible by preserving in-focus areas while discarding blurred areas. The quality of fused images is of fundamental importance. Many objective quality metrics for image fusion have been proposed. However, the evaluation of fused images is still a difficult task, especially because there is no reference image to compare with. Blind image quality assessment refers to the problem of evaluating the visual quality of an image without any reference. In this paper, we describe a blind image fusion quality assessment procedure based on the use of mutual information (MI). This procedure is concise and explicit and will be useful in scenarios where the absence of a reference image can hamper the assessment of the results. Furthermore, several image fusion algorithms have been rated and they have shown that our metric is compliant with subjective evaluations. Consequently, it can be used to compare different image fusion methods or to optimize the parameter settings for a given fusion algorithm."

It is usually thought that this game is already solved, given general results in game theory. However, the determination of equilibria is not feasible for the general case because of the well known problem of node explosion in the tree expressing the game. We propose a new model based in limited forecast as a kind of bounded rationality for dynamic alternate games."

It is known that $2n$-renaming can be solved if and only if $n+1$ is not a prime power. However, the previous proof of solvability was not constructive, involving a complex approximation theorem, and so it did not yield a concrete upper bound on the complexity of the resulting protocol. Here, we present the first upper bound on the step complexity of $2n$-renaming, whenever it is solvable, i.e., when $n+1$ is not a prime power. The paper also presents the first lower bound on the output namespace, showing that if $n+1$ is not a prime power and $n$ is a prime power, then $2n$ is a tight bound on the output namespace for $n+1$ processes."

In particular, consensus is I-set agreement. In PODC 2008 Zielinski showed that the anti-Omega failure detector is necessary and sufficient to solve (n - 1)-set agreement in an asynchronous read/write shared memory system where at most n - 1 processes can fail by crashing. This paper generalizes Zielinski's result: it shows that anti-Omega(t) is the weakest failure detector to solve t-set agreement in a t-resilient asynchronous distributed system. Each query to anti-Omega(t) returns a set S of process ids, vertical bar S vertical bar = n - t such that some correct process eventually never appears in any such set S; thus, anti-Omega(n-1) = anti-Omega, and anti-Omega(1) = Omega. Actually, the paper shows a stronger result: Any failure detector that can be used to solve T is at least as strong as anti-Omega(t), for any agreement task T that has no t-resilient solution."

This paper studies implementations of an eventual leader, namely an Ω failure detector, in a (not necessarily complete) connected network of eventual ADD channels, where processes may fail by crashing. It presents an algorithm that assumes that the processes initially know n, the total number of processes, sending messages of size O(log n)."

As result, a computer model of the esophagus and the stomach was obtained, mainly for modeling swallowing disorders. A central-axis curve was also obtained for virtual navigation and to replicate conditions relevant to swallowing disorders modeling. We show renderings of the model and discuss its use for simulating swallowing as a function of bolus rheological properties.

This could be achieved with a control system that monitors the produced power and modifies the fuel intake accordingly. In this work we develop such a system based on a fuzzy logic controller which adjusts the external parameters to keep the plasma temperature and density at the design values of a reactor of the characteristics of ITER. The control parameters chosen are the D-T refueling rate, the auxiliary heating power and a neutral Helium source. We use a fuzzy controller of the Mamdani type that uses a number of membership functions appropriate to produce a response to parameter deviations that minimizes the response time. The inference rules are determined in a way to provide stabilization to all initial perturbations of the temperature, density and alpha particle fraction. The dynamical response of the reactor is simulated with a zero-dimensional model that uses confinement times provided by the ITER scaling. We show how the system is feedback stabilized for a large range of parameters comprising ±25% around the nominal values. The recovery time after an initial perturbation from the steady state is within the range of one to tens of seconds depending on the type of initial perturbations applied, even with a noise term added to the energy confinement time.

For instance, it is now quite common for cars to use a number of intelligent units with intercommunication to implement complex functions such as traction control. There has also been a move towards embedding processing in sensors and actuators directly with application to the process control, automotive and aerospace sectors. When considering aerospace applications there are major benefits to be gained by adopting a distributed controller. However, this has to be carried out within the strict design constraints for safety-critical systems.

The complete system allows the elaboration and analysis of cartographies of corneal endothelial tissue, and hence the in vitro study of the spatial distribution of corneal endothelial cells, according to their regional morphometric characteristics (cell size and polygonality). The global cartographic reconstruction is obtained by sequential integration of the data analysed for each microscopic field. Subsequently, the location of each microscopically analysed field is referred to its real position on the histologic preparation by means of X-Y co-ordinates; both are provided by micrometric optoelectronic sensors installed on the optical microscope stage.

The complete system allows the elaboration and analysis of cartographies of corneal endothelial tissue, and hence the in vitro study of the spatial distribution of corneal endothelial cells, according to their regional morphometric characteristics (cell size and polygonality). The global cartographic reconstruction is obtained by sequential integration of the data analysed for each microscopic field. Subsequently, the location of each microscopically analysed field is referred to its real position on the histologic preparation by means of X-Y co-ordinates; both are provided by micrometric optoelectronic sensors installed on the optical microscope stage.

The CCDSF extends and unifies three existing frameworks: (i) the Function-Behavior-Structure framework for designing, to integrate design domain-specific knowledge; (ii) the Creative Systems Framework, to model design as a creative process; and (iii) the Conceptual Spaces Theory framework, to define the CCDSF at a more neutral level to be compatible with both the conceptual-space nature of the creative process and the implementation-level representation systems. The CCDSF core is a layered schema that structures the activity of designing through design concepts produced by design processes instrumented by agent-specific perception and action strategies, within a hierarchy of what we call design levels. Each layer of the schema constitutes a creative system that can implement exploratory, combinational, and transformational creativity mechanisms, including the possibility of defining the system at a meta-creative level. The hierarchical arrangement of creative systems defines the architecture of a CCDS. This architecture enables modeling CCDSs considering both the perspective of the generation and evaluation of artifacts that could be deemed creative and the precise modeling of the cognitive process of design, emphasizing its situated nature. To illustrate its usefulness, in the last part of this paper, we use the proposed framework to describe a real system in the videogame design domain."

In this paper we propose that, during development, cells within growing organs obtain positional information from a macroscopic physical field that is produced in space while cells are proliferating. This dynamical interaction triggers and responds to chemical and genetic processes that are specific to each biological system. We chose the root apical meristem of Arabidopsis thaliana to develop our dynamical model because this system is well studied at the molecular, genetic and cellular levels and has the key traits of multicellular stem-cell niches. We built a dynamical model that couples fundamental molecular mechanisms of the cell cycle to a tension physical field and to auxin dynamics, both of which are known to play a role in root development. We perform extensive numerical calculations that allow for quantitative comparison with experimental measurements that consider the cellular patterns at the root tip. Our model recovers, as an emergent pattern, the transition from proliferative to transition and elongation domains, characteristic of stem-cell niches in multicellular organisms. In addition, we successfully predict altered cellular patterns that are expected under various applied auxin treatments or modified physical growth conditions. Our modeling platform may be extended to explicitly consider gene regulatory networks or to treat other developmental systems. © 2013 Barrio et al."

Our paper highlights the role of a cellular switching mechanism to orchestrate such circuits. The cellular switch makes the circuits reconfigurable, robust, adaptable, and externally controllable. Without this cellular mechanism, the circuit rhythms entirely rely on specific tunings of the synaptic connectivity, which makes them rigid, fragile, and difficult to control externally. We illustrate those properties on the much studied architecture of a small network controlling both the pyloric and gastric rhythms of crabs. The cellular switch is provided by a slow negative conductance often neglected in mathematical modeling of central pattern generators. We propose that this conductance is simple to model and key to computational studies of rhythmic circuit neuromodulation. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

A staining procedure using methylene blue helps to enhance the contrast between aggregates and background without altering aggregate size distribution. Sample dilution affected the distribution of the population and therefore should be avoided. Mixing and aeration conditions during culture play an important role in the aggregation of A. vinelandii. Cells grown under mild mixing conditions (unbaffled flasks) presented a thick slime layer and formed aggregates of up to 35 μm of average equivalent diameter. In contrast, under strong agitation conditions (baffled flasks) practically no aggregates were formed throughout cultivation.

A staining procedure using methylene blue helps to enhance the contrast between aggregates and background without altering aggregate size distribution. Sample dilution affected the distribution of the population and therefore should be avoided. Mixing and aeration conditions during culture play an important role in the aggregation of A. vinelandii. Cells grown under mild mixing conditions (unbaffled flasks) presented a thick slime layer and formed aggregates of up to 35 μm of average equivalent diameter. In contrast, under strong agitation conditions (baffled flasks) practically no aggregates were formed throughout cultivation. The method described can be used for the characterization of aggregation of other microbial cultures. © 2002 Federation of European Microbiological Societies. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

Their diagnosis is a time-consuming task that, in many cases, delays treatments. On the other hand, discrete orthogonal moments (DOMs) are a tool recently introduced in biomedical image analysis. Here, we propose a combination of DOMs to help in the diagnosis of leukemia and lymphomas. We classify the IICBU2008-lymphoma dataset that includes three hematologic malignancies: chronic lymphocytic leukemia, follicular lymphoma, and mantle cell lymphoma. Our methodology analyzes such diseases in the hema-toxylin and eosin color space. We also include feature analysis to preserve the most discriminating characteristics of the malignant tissues. Finally, the classification of the samples is performed with kernel Fisher discriminant analysis. The accuracy is 93.85%. The results show the proposal could be useful in different biomedical applications. © 2016 IEEE."
11841,Characterization of land cover by multi temporal biophysical variables in fused images,2007,Boris Escalante Ramírez,Facultad de Ingeniería,,,,10.1109/IPTA.2016.7821039,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-42149160264&doi=10.1117%2f12.735596&partnerID=40&md5=c52866c5e42090907ff917a48a2d9cab,SIAV,Biology; Image Processing,Biophysical variable; Hermite transform; Images fusion; Land cover;Biophysical variables; Hermite transforms; Land cover; Image fusion; Mathematical transformations; Remote sensing; Satellites; Sensor networks; Soils; Vectors; Vegetation; Land use,"Nowadays, it is very common to have readily available remotely-sensed spatial information, at different resolutions, thanks to the different satellite sensors that are acquiring multispectral images at both low and high resolutions. Fusion techniques have then arisen as an alternative to integrate this information, which result in new images that contain better spectral and spatial information in terms of contents and resolution. Several fusion techniques based on the Wavelet transformation have been developed, in which the ""à trous"" algorithm stands out as one of the most important tool that is able to preserve spectral and spatial properties. As an alternative, we have introduced an algorithm based on an undecimated Hermite transform (HT) that preserves these properties, with better image quality. In this paper, fused images are analyzed in the framework of biophysical-variables such as leaf-area-index and sparse-fractional-vegetation-cover, all of them derived from reflectance values in the visible-red and near-infrared bands, from multi-temporal SPOT-5 images [2005-2007]. Multi-temporal analyses are conducted to test the consistency of these variables for different illumination conditions, and vegetation amount, in order to determine indicators of land-cover-change. Results were used to characterize a change vector analysis, by differentiating land transformation from modifications based on the results with fused and original images. Results also showed how the HT algorithm resulted in the smallest modification of the bi-dimensional space of the vegetation and soil isolines after fusion. This method also preserves the information integrity necessitated to obtain similar biophysical variable values. By improving spatial resolution, while preserving spectral characteristics of the resulting images, the HT-based algorithm is able to better characterize land-cover-change."

In this sense, it has been sought out the development of small interfaces to avoid any type of user annoyance. In this paper, bioelectric signals have been analyzed and characterized in order to propose a more natural human-machine interaction system. The proposed scheme is controlled by electromyographic signals that a person can create through arm movements. Such arm signals have been analyzed and characterized by a back-propagation neural network, and by a wavelet analysis, in this way control commands were obtained from such arm electromyographic signals. The developed interface, uses Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) to send control commands remotely. In the experiment, it manipulated a vehicle that was approximately 52 km away from the user, with which it can be showed that a characterized electromyographic signal can be sufficient for controlling embedded devices such as a Raspberri Pi, and in this way we can use the neural network and the wavelet analysis to generate control words which can be used inside the Internet of Things too. A Tiva-C board has been used to acquire data instead of more popular development boards, with an adequate response. One of the most important aspects related to the proposed interface is that it can be used by almost anyone, including people with different abilities and even illiterate people. Due to the existence of individual efforts to characterize different types of bioelectric signals, we propose the generation of free access Bioelectric Control Dictionary, to define and consult each characterized biosignal."

The fluid consists of hard sphere particles. On the other hand, the adsorbents of this study are modeled as a collection of hard spheres with their diameter obeying a certain distribution function. Our focus is in the evaluation of the chemical potential of the fluid immersed in such a polydisperse material. It permits us to obtain porosity and pore size distribution for the adsorbent, as well as a set of adsorption isotherms. The latter have been calculated theoretically and by grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations. We observe that the width of assumed polydispersity distribution affects all the properties of the system. Nevertheless, the effect of matrix packing is dominant in determining adsorption for this class of models. We are convinced that the matrix structures generated via more sophisticated algorithms would exhibit stronger effects of polydispersity on the entire set of properties of adsorbed simple fluids."

Indeed, this area has made progress, and the combined use of several sensors has been so successful that many authors proposed variants of fusion methods, to the point that it is now hard to tell which of them is the best for a given set of sensors and a given application context. To address the issue of choosing an adequate fusion method, we recently proposed a machine-learning data-driven approach able to predict the best merging strategy. This approach uses a meta-data set with the Statistical signatures extracted from data sets of a particular domain, from which we train a prediction model. However, the mentioned work is restricted to the recognition of human activities. In this paper, we propose to extend our previous work to other very different contexts, such as gas detection and grammatical face expression identification, in order to test its generality. The extensions of the method are presented in this paper. Our experimental results show that our extended model predicts the best fusion method well for a given data set, making us able to claim a broad generality for our sensor fusion method."

Generalized recombination is a new model for the exchange of genetic material from parents to offspring that generalizes and subsumes standard operators, such as homologous crossover, inversion and duplication, and in which a particular gene in the offspring may originate from any parental gene. It is shown that the dynamics naturally coarse grains, the appropriate effective degrees of freedom being schemata that act as building blocks. It is shown that the Schema dynamics has the same functional form as that of strings and we derive a corresponding exact Schema theorem. To exhibit the qualitatively new phenomena that can occur in the presence of generalized recombination, and to understand the biases of the operator, we derive a complete, exact solution for a two-locus model without selection, showing how the dynamical behavior is radically different to that of homologous crossover. Inversion is shown to potentially introduce oscillations in the dynamics, while gene duplication leads to an asymmetry between homogeneous and heterogeneous strings. All nonhomologous operators lead to allele ldquodiffusionrdquo along the chromosome. We discuss how inferences from the two-locus results extend to the case of a recombinative genetic algorithm with selection and more than two loci providing evidence from an integration of the exact dynamical equations for more than two loci."

With this method, the processing of image data is performed in three steps: restoration, segmentation and coastline segment extraction. The problem of image restoration is solved via the polynomial transform. Based on the Markov random field theory, a model for image segmentation is applied. Optimization is achieved by a classical stochastic relaxation technique. The polynomial transform is an image description model which incorporates important properties of visual perception, such as the Gaussian-derivative model of early vision. Based on this, we present a technique for directional-sensitive image restoration. The restored image is obtained by means of an inverse polynomial transform which consists of interpolating the transformed coefficients with pattern functions that are products of a polynomial and a window function. We show in this paper how noise reduction task can be improved by detecting the position and orientation of relevant contours in images degraded by speckle. This method is applied in a coarse-to-fine resolution approach, in which, contour location is not degraded even at the stage of high resolution processing. The presented method performs in a semiautomatic fashion to effectively detect coastlines."

However, any modification in both structures has an integrated impact which is necessary to measure. In that respect the use of time delay impact is a suitable strategy to be followed and is explored in this paper. The use of codesign is to pursuit as a two objective strategy the definition of a valid metric that represents the effects in both, following the idea that stability analysis is affected according to the schedullability analysis. In both analysis a relaxation at the local conditions is feasible but it will have a global cost giving a non valuable approximation."

Three kinds of decoding algorithms have been studied, two of them are «time domain» algorithms, while the third employs a transform decoding method. We achieve with this development, measurements that will permit the selection of the method with optimal decoding in the case of one future microprogramming implementation. Optimal decoding implies that the faster algorithm is the best one. It can be concluded that acceptable RS decoders can be constructed with microprocessors only for low speed transmission rates. © 1988, Springer-Verlag."

The specific needs of diverse student audiences’ forces educators and pedagogical engineers to redesign digital environments to foster collaborative and personal learning. As collaborative platforms evolve, rethinking their activity settings (task, artefact, scenario) becomes critical. The aim of this research is to assess whether the use of simultaneous private and public digital workspaces promotes collaborative knowledge building through the analysis of students’ performance and interactions in a collaborative concept map. The focus is on an experimentation carried out with 5 groups of tenth-grade history classes in two different high schools in France. The results show a tendency of the techno-pedagogical device to foster the collaborative knowledge building."

Researchers have tried different approaches to obtain the correct syntactic structure from analyzed sentences but not successful results have been obtained. Two different approaches have traditionally applied to syntactic analysis: constituent grammars and dependency grammars. We propose a model for syntactic analysis and disambiguation combining lexical dependencies and semantic proximity. Lexical dependencies are applied by means of a government pattern dictionary following the dependency approach. The semantic proximity is introduced by means of semantic closeness among constituents. Examples are given to illustrate method's contributions.

The motivation of these comments is the lack of a clear criterion in the WARP algorithm to distinguish between process deviations and faults scenarios, and as a consequence, the applicability of this algorithm is questionable from the FD point of view. Moreover, we address the absence of a formal justification why the computational complexity achieved by using the WARP algorithm is reduced in comparison with methods discussed in the paper."

The class of solvable tasks in this model is well-known, and turns out to be the same in various similar message-passing and shared-memory models. But only full-information protocols have been considered, which send messages that grow with the number of rounds. We show that for two processes, it is possible to solve any wait-free solvable task using mostly 1-bit messages, without incurring any cost in the optimal number of communication rounds. We identify an additional type of information that needs to be communicated: in some executions it is necessary to send messages of   logc+1  bits, where c is the chromatic number of the distance-2 graphs of input configurations of the two processes. But on average, the size of messages of a k-round protocol is at most   1+2logck  bits. Then, we show that it is possible to solve any wait-free solvable task by exchanging only beeps, at a constant cost in terms of number of rounds. Finally, for 3 processes, we show that messages of constant size do not suffice to solve every task in an optimal number of rounds."

This paper presents, to our knowledge, the first self-healing compact routing scheme. Besides, our schemes are developed for low memory nodes and are compact schemes, meaning they require only  bits memory .We introduce two algorithms of independent interest: The first is CompactFT, a novel compact version of the self-healing algorithm Forgiving Tree of Hayes et al. [7] that uses only  bits local memory. The second algorithm (CompactFTZ) combines CompactFT with Thorup–Zwicks tree-based compact routing scheme [4] to produce a compact self-healing routing scheme. In the self-healing model, the adversary deletes nodes one at a time and the affected nodes self-heal locally by adding few edges. We introduce the bounded-memory self-healing model, where the memory each node need to use for the self-healing algorithm is bounded. CompactFT recovers from each attack in only  time and Δ messages, with only +3 degree increase and  graph diameter increase, over any sequence of deletions (Δ is the initial maximum degree). Additionally, CompactFTZ guarantees delivery of a packet sent from sender s as long as the receiver t has not been deleted, with only an additional  latency, where y is the number of nodes that have been deleted on the path between s and t. If t has been deleted, s gets informed and the packet is removed from the network. CompactFTZ uses only  bits memory for local fields (such as routing tables) and  bits for the routing labels, thus requiring  bits overall."

The goal of this work was to find the optimal algorithm in order to build an automatic real-time system for diagnosing sputum smear samples, where both accuracy and computational time are important. We analyzed 13 focusing methods, ranging from well-known algorithms to the most recently proposed functions. We took into consideration criteria that are inherent to the autofocus function, such as accuracy, computational cost, and robustness to noise and to illumination changes.

In addition, these codes are compared to an implementation utilizing SHMEM the native data passing SGI/Cray environment for parallel programming. The multiprocessor platform used in the study is a SGI/Cray Origin 2000 with up to 32 processors, which supports all these programming models efficiently. The dynamical system used in this study is a nonlinear 0D model of a thermonuclear fusion reactor with the EDA-ITER design parameters. The results show that OpenMP outperforms the other two environments when large number of processors are involved, while yielding a similar or a slightly poorer behavior for small number of processors. As expected the native SGI/Cray environment outperforms MPI for the entire range of processors used. Reasons for the observed performance are given. The parallel efficiency of the code is always greater than 60% regardless of the parallel environment for the range of processors used in this study."

Because segmentation is one of the most challenging processes in medical applications, all the methods fail to achieve perfect results. The major problems are due to noise, poor contrast and high variation of structure shapes. In this paper, we review the principal level set - based methods that have been designed for image segmentation applications. These approaches include: Geodesic Active Contour, Chan-Vese Functional and Geodesic Active Regions. We also shortly analyze one of the first methods proposed for shape extraction in images by using level set representation (Malladi's method(6)). We make a comparative study of the performance obtained for each method applied on cardiac CT images which present strong and very marked differences regarding the contrast and shape variation of the structures. Left ventricle is selected as our structure of analysis. Sensitivity, specificity and a distance metric to compare similarities between shapes are used to evaluate the performance of the methods."

However, the full ecological niche depends on a myriad of factors, both biotic and abiotic, that often correspond to completely different data types. We applied a methodology based on data mining techniques to construct ecological niche models composed of biotic as well as abiotic variables using three quite different sets of variables: climatic layers, maps of land cover and point collections of Mexican mammals. We show how potential ecological interactions can be inferred from geographic data using co-occurrences as proxies, and generate corresponding distribution models. We consider two case studies: an insect genus (Lutzomyia sp.) and a mammal species (Lynx rufus). We show that for both examples model predictability is higher using biotic versus abiotic variables, but even higher when both variable types are integrated together. Also, by identifying those variables that are most relevant in describing the suitable (niche) and unsuitable (anti-niche) areas we can establish an ecological profile for any geographic location and quantify the relative influence of each location and its impact on species. In conclusion, we show that including both abiotic and biotic factors not only leads to a fuller more comprehensive understanding of the niche, but also leads to more accurate prediction models."

Low frequency magnetic (LFM) field stimulation, while inducing a variety of effects on several cell types, has never been studied as to its effects on chromaffin cell cultures. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of LFM field stimulation with that of NGF on the morphological phenotype, on noradrenaline (NA) release, and on membrane excitability of cultured chromaffin cells. We also tested the effects of grafting LFM and NGF-treated chromaffin cells into the caudate nucleus of rats with 6-hydroxydopamine lesions of the nigrostriatal pathway. The results of this study showed that LFM field stimulation produced neurite growth of cultured chromaffin cells in a manner similar to that of NGF exposure. The combination of the two procedures did not induce changes above those observed by NGF alone. Both NGF- and LFM-treated chromaffin cells released [3H]NA equally in response to a depolarizing concentration of KCl. On the other, Na+ current density of LFM field stimulation increased, but to a lesser extent than that seen in NGF-treated cells. In addition both types of cells when transplanted into nigrostriatal-lesioned animals induced a similar decrease in the motor asymmetries produced by the lesion. When NGF- or LFM-treated chromaffin cells where compared to untreated control cells, no significant differences were observed in [3H]NA release, on Na+ current densities, or on postgraft motor asymmetries. The results are discussed in terms of the fact that LFM-stimulated cells can be differentiated in a manner similar to NGF-treated cells, by acquiring sympathetic like traits which in turn can diminish motor asymmetries when grafted into nigrostriatal-lesioned rats. © 1994 Academic Press, Inc."

We demonstrate that although a mono camera system coupled to a LCD projector runs faster and at lower cost, the stereo camera system aided by structure lighting generates more accurate results"

A comparative study is presented in the context of a benchmark network under the same leak and sensor placement scenarios. The comparison considers four classification tools widely used in the pattern recognition framework: Nearest Neighbor, Bayes Classifier, Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines. The classifiers’ selection is made by considering their different working principles and application advantages. Training and testing sets are formed by the residuals generated by using the EPANET hydraulic simulator. The robustness of the methods is compared with respect to the leak location performance under model parameter uncertainty, demand uncertainty, leak size uncertainty and sensor noise. The SVM performs similar or better than the other classifiers when all uncertainties are present."

However, care must be taken when comparing static allometry between lineages exhibiting indeterminate versus determinate growth. It makes little sense to compare the continuous brain–body growth trajectories of adult fish, reptiles and amphibians with the brain–body weight variability of adult birds and mammals whose growth has ceased. Instead, we agree with Deacon2 that “comparing ontogenetic curves is ultimately the only way to provide some assurance that we are not comparing apples and oranges”. We therefore doubt that smaller slopes of static allometry in adult birds and mammals, which reflect weight variability across individuals whose brains have ceased growing, can help to explain their encephalization."

In order to fortify these kind of organisations, efficient strategies, practices, or guides to tailor SPI to their size and type of business are needed. Therefore, in this chapter, the COMPETISOFT project is presented.

We present the analysis of circa 49,000 examples obtained from Mexican newspapers. We detailed their structure and give some notions about the context surrounding them. Since named entities belong to open class of words they are being created daily, so the challenge for a named entity recognizer is to precisely determine the boundaries of new entity names in any text and to analyze thoroughly their components for deep semantic analysis.

Code text written in artificial languages showed higher entropy than text of similar length expressed in natural languages. Spanish texts exhibit more symbolic diversity than English ones. Results showed that algorithms based on complexity measures differentiate artificial from natural languages, and that text analysis based on complexity measures allows the unveiling of important aspects of their nature. We propose specific expressions to examine entropy related aspects of tests and estimate the values of entropy, emergence, self-organization, and complexity based on specific diversity and message length.

Sensors are initially located in the plane and they can relocate to the barriers. We assume that each sensor can detect any intruder in a circular area of fixed range centered at the sensor. Given a set of barriers and a set of sensors located in the plane, we study three problems: (i) the feasibility of barrier coverage, (ii) the problem of minimizing the largest relocation distance of a sensor (MinMax), and (iii) the problem of minimizing the sum of relocation distances of sensors (MinSum). When sensors are permitted to move to arbitrary positions on the barrier, the MinMax problem is shown to be strongly NP-complete for sensors with arbitrary ranges. We also study the case when sensors are restricted to use perpendicular movement to one of the barriers. We show that when the barriers are parallel, both the MinMax and MinSum problems can be solved in polynomial time. In contrast, we show that even the feasibility problem is strongly NP-complete if two perpendicular barriers are to be covered, even if the sensors are located at integer positions, and have only two possible sensing ranges. On the other hand, we give an O(n3/2) algorithm for a natural special case of this last problem. © 2015 Elsevier B.V."

To date there has been little agreement on how to properly describe complexity in terms of ecology. In this regard, this manuscript assesses the significance of using a set of proposed measures based on information theory. These measures are as follows: emergence, self -organization, complexity, homeostasis and autopoiesis. A combination of quantitative and qualitative approaches was used in the data analysis with the aim to apply these proposed measures. This study systematically reviews the data previously collected and generated by a model carried out on four aquatic ecosystems located between the Arctic region and the tropical zone. Thus, this research discusses the case of exploring a high level of self-organization in terms of movement, distribution, and quality of water between the northern temperate zone and the tropics. Moreover, it was assessed the significance of the presence of a complex variable (pH) in the middle of the latitudinal transect. Similarly, this study explores the relationship between self-organization and limiting nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus and silicates). Furthermore, the importance of how a biomass subsystem is affected by seasonal variations is highlighted in this manuscript. This case study seeks to examine the changing nature of how seasonality affects the complexity dynamics of photosynthetic taxa (lakes located in northern temperate zone) at high latitudes, and it also investigates how a high level of self-organization at the tropical zone can lead to increase the amount of planktonic and benthic fish which determines the dynamics of complexity. This research also compares the emerging role of how a biomass subsystem has a highest temporal dynamics compared to he limiting nutrients' subsystem. In the same way, the results associated to autopoiesis reflect a moderate degree of autonomy of photosynthetic biomass. It is also discussed the case of how complexity values change in the middle of the latitudinal gradient for all components. Finally, a comparison with Tsallis information was carried out in order to determine that these proposed measures are more suitable due to they are independent of any other parameter. Thus, this approach considers some elements closely related to information theory which determine and better describe ecological dynamics. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Any surface can be seen as a 3-D object and studied as such. 3-D voxel-based surfaces are described using a 3-D tree structure known as an enclosing tree. A modified version of this structure is used to describe the surface. In order to describe the surfaces, we used the enclosing trees that are represented via the orthogonal direction change chain code. The representation obtained is compared with the original to verify if proper data compression is achieved."

In this reference the contact perimeter was used to define a measure of compactness for 2D shapes. Now, in this paper we use the contact perimeter to compute the Euler number of unit-width objects composed of different side-connected cells and face-connected polyhedrons in two and three dimensions, respectively.

In the case of the evaluation of ankylosing spondylitis the Schober's test or modified Schober's test is commonly used to evaluate the subject. The test is based on a set of physical exercises providing an index of mobility; some of the tests are the lower back under flexion, neck mobility, Occiput-to-Wall measurement, and leg-split capacity. The obtained indexes are used to evaluate the current condition of the subject. Traditionally these measurements are obtained manually by the specialist and there are questions related to the correct execution of each activity, subject by subject. In order to provide a more accurate method that can be used to assess the full range of movements, a tridimensional tracking system based on the Kinect v2 sensor is proposed and evaluated in this work. © 2016 Author(s)."

One commonly investigated regularizing function is total variation (TV), while other publications advocate the use of some type of multiscale geometric transform in the definition of the regularizing function, a particular recent choice for this is the shearlet transform. Proponents of the shearlet transform in the regularizing function claim that the reconstructions so obtained are better than those produced using TV for texture preservation (but may be worse for noise reduction). In this paper we report results related to this claim. In our reported experiments using simulated CT data collection of the head, reconstructions whose shearlet transform has a small l(1)-norm are not more efficacious than reconstructions that have a small TV value. Our experiments for making such comparisons use the recently-developed superiorization methodology for both regularizing functions. Superiorization is an automated procedure for turning an iterative algorithm for producing images that satisfy a primary criterion (such as consistency with the observed measurements) into its superiorized version that will produce results that, according to the primary criterion are as good as those produced by the original algorithm, but in addition are superior to them according to a secondary (regularizing) criterion. The method presented for superiorization involving the l(1)-norm of the shearlet transform is novel and is quite general: It can be used for any regularizing function that is defined as the l(1)-norm of a transform specified by the application of a matrix. Because in the previous literature the split Bregman algorithm is used for similar purposes, a section is included comparing the results of the superiorization algorithm with the split Bregman algorithm."

A process runs solo when it computes its local output without receiving any information from other processes, either because they crashed or they are too slow. While in wait-free shared-memory models at most one process may run solo in an execution, any number of processes may have to run solo in an asynchronous wait-free message-passing model. This paper is on the computability power of models in which several processes may concurrently run solo. It first introduces a family of round-based wait-free models, called the d-solo models, 1 ≤ d ≤ n, where up to d processes may run solo. The paper gives then a characterization of the colorless tasks that can be solved in each d-solo model. It also introduces the (d,ε)-solo approximate agreement task, which generalizes ε-approximate agreement, and proves that (d,ε)-solo approximate agreement can be solved in the d-solo model, but cannot be solved in the (d + 1)-solo model. The paper studies also the relation linking d-set agreement and (d,ε)-solo approximate agreement in asynchronous wait-free message-passing systems. These results establish for the first time a hierarchy of wait-free models that, while weaker than the basic read/write model, are nevertheless strong enough to solve non-trivial tasks."

Shellable Complexes have been studied in the combinatorial topology literature because they have many nice properties. It turns out that many standard models of concurrent computation can be captured either as shellable complexes, or as the simple union of shellable complexes. We consider general adversaries in the synchronous, asynchronous, and semi-synchronous message-passing models, as well as asynchronous shared memory augmented by consensus and set agreement objects. We show how to exploit their common shellability structure to derive new and remarkably succinct tight (or nearly so) lower bounds on connectivity of protocol complexes and hence on solutions to the k-set agreement task in these models."

This paper investigates Cf, the largest set of conditions which allow us to solve the consensus problem in an asynchronous shared memory system. The first part of the paper shows that Cf is made up of a hierarchy of classes of conditions, Cf[d] where d is a parameter (called degree of the condition), starting with d = min(n - f, f) and ending with d = 0, where Cf[0] = Cf. We prove that each one is strictly contained in the previous one: Cf[d] ⊂ Cf[d - 1]. Various properties of the hierarchy are also derived. It is shown that a class can be characterized in two equivalent but complementary ways: one is convenient for designing protocols while the other is for analyzing the class properties. The paper also defines a linear family of conditions that can be used to derive many specific conditions. In particular, for each d, two natural conditions are presented. The second part of the paper is devoted to the design of efficient condition-based protocols. A generic condition-based protocol is presented. This protocol can be instantiated with any condition C, C ∈ Cf[d], and requires at most (2n+1) ⌈ log2(⌈(f - d)/2 ⌉ + 1) ⌉ shared memory read/write operations per process in the synchronization part of the protocol. Thus, the value (f - d) represents the 'difficulty' of the class Cf[d]. An improvement of the protocol for the conditions in Cf[0] is also presented"

A class of conditions that allow to solve k-set agreement in spite of f crashes in an asynchronous system is identified. A k-set agreement protocol that is always safe is described: it is guaranteed to terminate when the input vector belongs to C and it always decides-on at most k different values, even if the input vector does not belong to C. While there are simple solutions when f < k, it is known that the k-set agreement problem-has no solution when f greater than or equal to k. Thus, the paper identifies classes of conditions that allow to solve this problem even when f greater than or equal to k. The paper gives evidence that these are the only conditions that allow to solve set agreement, by proving the wait-free case. Two natural concrete conditions that belong to such a class are described. Finally, a more efficient k-set agreement protocol with only linear complexity (doe's not use snapshots), for any C that allows to solve consensus, when k less than or equal to f / (n - f) + 1 is presented. This shows how to trade fault-tolerance for agreement precision using the condition based approach."

The approach studies conditions that identify sets of input vectors for which it is possible to solve consensus despite the occurrence of up to f process crashes. The first main result defines acceptable conditions and shows that these are exactly the conditions for which a consensus protocol exists. Two examples of realistic acceptable conditions are presented, and proved to be maximal, in the sense that they cannot be extended and remain acceptable. The second main result is a generic consensus shared-memory protocol for any acceptable condition. The protocol always guarantees agreement and validity, and terminates (at least) when the inputs satisfy the condition with which the protocol has been instantiated, or when there are no crashes. An efficient version of the protocol is then designed for the message passing model that works when f < n/2, and it is shown that no such protocol exists when f greater than or equal to n/2. It is also shown how the protocol's safety can be traded for its liveness."

Changes are driven by a powerful adversary that can look at internal process states and add and remove edges in order to contrast the convergence of the algorithm to the correct count. The paper proposes two leader-based counting algorithms. Such algorithms are based on a technique that mimics an energy-transfer between network nodes.The first algorithm assumes that the adversary cannot generate either disconnected network graphs or network graphs where nodes have degree greater than D. In such algorithm, the leader can count the size of the network and detect the counting termination in a finite time (i.e., conscious counting algorithm). The second algorithm assumes that the adversary only keeps the network graph connected at any time and we prove that the leader can still converge to a correct count in a finite number of rounds, but it is not conscious when this convergence happens."

The theory is focused on a constructive process that synthesizes a function in the geometric domain representing a geometric concept. Geometric theorems are instances of this kind of concepts. The theory involves four main conceptual components: conservation principles, action schemes, descriptions of geometric abstractions and reinterpretations of diagrams emerging during the generative process. A notion of diagrammatic derivation in which the external representation and its interpretation are synthesized in tandem is also introduced in this paper. The theory is exemplified with a diagrammatic proof of the Theorem of Pythagoras. The theory also illustrates how the arithmetic interpretation of this theorem is produced in tandem with its diagrammatic derivation under an appropriate representational mapping. A second case study in which an arithmetic theorem is synthesized from an underlying geometric concept is also included. An interactive prototype program in which the inference load is shared between the system and the human user is also presented. The paper is concluded with a reflection on the expressive power of diagrams, their effectiveness in representation and inference, and the relation between synthetic and analytic knowledge in the realization of theorems and their proofs."

In each trial, a first stimulus (f1) must be stored in short-term memory and later compared with a second stimulus (f2), for the animal to come to a binary decision. Prefrontal cortex (PFC) neurons need to interpret the f1 information in one way (perhaps with a positive weight) and the f2 information in an opposite way (perhaps with a negative weight), although they come from the very same secondary somatosensory cortex (S2) neurons; therefore, a functional sign inversion is required. This task thus provides a clear example of context-dependent processing. Here we develop a biologically plausible model of a context-dependent signal transformation of the stimulus encoding from S2 to PFC. To ground our model in experimental neurophysiology, we use neurophysiological data recorded by R. Romo's laboratory from both cortical area S2 and PFC in monkeys performing the task. Our main goal is to use experimentally observed context-dependent modulations of firing rates in cortical area S2 as the basis for a model that achieves a context-dependent inversion of the sign of S2 to PFC connections. This is done without requiring any changes in connectivity (Salinas, 2004b). We (1) characterize the experimentally observed context-dependent firing rate modulation in area S2, (2) construct a model that results in the sign transformation, and (3) characterize the robustness and consequent biological plausibility of the model.

To this end, it requires a fast and robust method to acquire, process and communicate to a robot the information about positioning and orientation of an object for assembly purposes. In this way, the robot as a central element can request tasks carried out within a manufacturing cell instrumented with a vision system that acquires images of the pieces and assembly objects to guide its movements. The article shows the explanation of the used algorithm and its simulation in MatLab 7.0 with specific instances of images of forms of objects. Robot vision systems can differentiate parts by pattern matching irrespective of part orientation and location. Some manufacturers offer 3D guidance systems using robust vision and laser systems so that a 3D programmed point can be repeated even if the part is moved varying its location, rotation and orientation within the working space. Despite these developments, current industrial robots are still unable to recognize objects in a robust manner; that is, to distinguish an object among equally shaped objects taking into account not only the object's contour but also its form and depth information. Having a robust and fast method for contour object generation for object recognition manufacturing tasks improves this methodology and allows the implementation of these algorithms in devices like FPGA's, which gives the object recognition applications in manufacturing cell a real possibility of fast and robust performance demanded by industrial environments."

In this way, it is possible to obtain a process of learning the location and the recognition of parts for manufacturing purposes, and for its subsequent recognition and manipulation by a manipulator robot. To this end, it requires a fast and robust method to acquire, process and communicate to a robot the information about positioning and orientation of an object for assembly purposes. In this way, the robot as a central element can request tasks carried out within a manufacturing cell instrumented with a vision system that acquires images of the pieces and assembly objects to guide its movements. The article shows the explanation of the used algorithm and its simulation in MatLab 7.0 with specific instances of images of forms of objects. Robot vision systems can differentiate parts by pattern matching irrespective of part orientation and location. Some manufacturers offer 3D guidance systems using robust vision and laser systems so that a 3D programmed point can be repeated even if the part is moved varying its location, rotation and orientation within the working space. Despite these developments, current industrial robots are still unable to recognize objects in a robust manner; that is, to distinguish an object among equally shaped objects taking into account not only the object's contour but also its form and depth information. Having a robust and fast method for contour object generation for object recognition manufacturing tasks improves this methodology and allows the implementation of these algorithms in devices like FPGA's, which gives the object recognition applications in manufacturing cell a real possibility of fast and robust performance demanded by industrial environments."

The objective is to guide the mobile robot to arrive at a goal pose (position and orientation) started from an initial pose in the environment where there may be static obstacles that can be observed by the camera. The control scheme consists in three modules: the control module which ensures the exponential tracking to a desired trajectory; the on-line path/trajectory planning module which plans the desired path using LOS (Light-of-Sight) strategy and then parametrizes it into a trajectory; and the depth-estimation module which takes a sequence of target image along the path in the CCD camera mounted in the mobile robot to estimate the target Cartesian coordinate in the inertial frame and passes it to the path/trajectory module. The trajectory tracking controller and the depth observer are devised relying on the contraction analysis ensuring the exponential convergence in both designs. Simulations are included to illustrate the control scheme.

Trade-off between payload, robustness and imperceptibility is a very important aspect which has to be considered when a watermark algorithm is designed. In our proposed scheme, previously to be embedded into the image, the watermark signal is encoded using a convolutional encoder, which can perform forward error correction achieving better robustness performance. Then, the embedding process is carried out through the discrete cosine transform domain (DCT) of an image using the image normalization technique to accomplish robustness against geometric and signal processing distortions. The embedded watermark coded bits are extracted and decoded using the Viterbi algorithm. In order to determine the presence or absence of the watermark into the image we compute the bit error rate (BER) between the recovered and the original watermark data sequence. The quality of the watermarked image is measured using the well-known indices: Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), Visual Information Fidelity (VIF) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM). The color difference between the watermarked and original images is obtained by using the Normalized Color Difference (NCD) measure. The experimental results show that the proposed method provides good performance in terms of imperceptibility and robustness. The comparison among the proposed and previously reported methods based on different techniques is also provided."

Connectivity between any two nodes is established when the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) between the corresponding time series is greater than or equal to a threshold H, resulting in similarity networks with interesting properties. In particular, these networks can have high average clustering coefficients and the ""small world"" property, and their degree distribution can vary from scale-free to quasiconstant depending on H. A giant component of size N exists until a critical threshold Hc is crossed, at which point relatively rare walks begin to detach from it and remain isolated. This model can be used as a first step for building a null hypothesis for networks constructed from time series. © 2018 American Physical Society."

The proposed method takes advantage of the optical properties of the surfaces of most microbial colonies. Colonies in the petri dish are epi-illuminated in order to direct the reflection of concentrated light coming from a halogen lamp towards an imagesensing device. In conjunction, a multilevel threshold algorithm is proposed for colony separation and counting. These procedures improved the quantification of colonies showing confluence or differences in size. We tested COVASIAM with a sample set of microorganisms that form colonies with contrasting physical properties: Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Aspergillus nidulans, Escherichia coli, Azotobacter vinelandii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Rhizobium etli. These physical properties range from smooth to hairy, from bright to opaque, and from high to low convexities. COVASIAM estimated an average of 95.47% (σ = 8.55%) of the manually counted colonies, while an automated method based on a single-threshold segmentation procedure estimated an average of 76% (σ = 16.27) of the manually counted colonies. This method can be easily transposed to almost every image-processing analyzer since the procedures to compile it are generically standard."

The proposed scheme is based on two modifications introduced in two 2D histograms. In the first modification a selected region of a 2D histogram, composed by red and green (R-G) color components, is modified according to the watermark bit sequence; while in the second modification another 2D histogram, composed by blue (B) and filtered red (R) components, is partitioned into several blocks to embed the watermark data bits. The experimental results show fairly good robustness against several geometric distortions, common signal processing operations and some quite aggressive combined attacks. A watermark robustness comparison with the related works and an analysis of the embedding method from the watermark robustness point of view are provided, in order to explain the robustness improvement of the proposed algorithm, especially against rotation and cropping attacks. The ROC curves also provided to show the desirable detection performance of the proposed method. Comparisons with the previously reported methods, based on different techniques, are also provided."

Conversely, (2) adding transitions to satisfy an existential subformula may dissatisfy some universal subformulas. To overcome these difficulties, we employ protections of the form , recording information about the satisfaction of subformulas previously treated by the algorithm. Intuitively, (1) E is the set of transitions that we cannot remove without compromising the satisfaction of previously treated subformulas. Conversely, (2) A is the set of transitions that we can add. Hence, update proceeds without diminishing E and without augmenting A. Finally, (3) L is a set of literals protecting the model labels.

SPSD can describe the textural or morphological properties of a surface by obtaining a property field descriptor based on the points shape descriptors and a smoothing function over a neighborhood of each point. The neighborhood size depends on a smoothing distance function which drives the field descriptor to either focus on small local details or larger details over big surfaces. SPSD is designed to provide a real-time scientific visualization of cloud points shape descriptors to assist in the field study of archaeological artifacts. It also has the potential to provide quantitative values (e.g. morphological properties) for artifacts analysis and classification (computational and archaeological). Due to the visualisation requirement for a real-time solution, SPSD is implemented in CUDA using an Octree method as the mechanism to solve the neighborhood particles interaction for each point cloud."

Each component takes a copy of its local state and sends it to one of the components in Bi, in such a way that each component stores (approximately) the same number of local states. Afterward, if a component of Bi crashes, all of its stored data is lost and the computation cannot continue. If there exists a block with no failed components in it, then a recent global state can be retrieved and the computation does not need to start over from the very beginning. The goal is to design storage schemes that tolerate as many crashes as possible, while trying to have each component participating in as few blocks as possible and, at the same time, working with large blocks (so that a component in a block stores a small number of local states).

For the solution of this realistic issue, which commonly occurs in pipeline networks, the position of the branch junction and its flow rate are supposed to be known. The idea consists of deriving a model considering the branch junction as a known point in the pipeline such that the leak position is characterized by two possible orientations with respect to the branch (upstream and downstream of it). Thus, this model allows proposing a diagnosis scheme which includes a static selector and two identifiers designed by using a continuous extended Kalman filter with only one deviation parameter to be estimated. This framework reduces the identification task to one parameter which is associated with the deviation from a prescribed positive base position located between one of the pipeline ends and the branch.

Cyber physical systems (CPS) integrate physical assets with embedded systems. Smart water networks are CPS formed by the distribution system of pipes together with sensors, actuators, programmable logic controllers (PLCs) and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system. The proposed strategy combines three signal processing tools: Principal Component Analysis, the Adaptive Exponential Weighted Moving Average Chart and the Reconstruction-based Contribution method. The proposal is tested with the data published in the BATtle of the Attack Detection ALgorithms (BATADAL) competition (http://www.batadal.net). The results show that the proposed DSS allows the detection of all the attacks from the test data set 3 with a satisfactory performance by using only data from the normal behavior (data set 1). The proposed DSS can also successfully identify the area of the network and the physical component(s) under attack for different scenarios (first three attacks). © 2019"

The high abiotic reactivity has been the most acceptable explanation for the apparently absence of organic matter in the regolith. Earth soils that have geochemical properties similar to those expected on the surface of Mars could help to decipher this question on the surface and shallow subsurface of the Red Planet. This work aims to demonstrate that the place known as the Pampas de La Joya desert in southern Peru, contains soils that have nonbiological chemical decomposition mechanisms of organic compounds under conditions of the Viking Labeled Release Experiment (LRx). We compare the organic decomposition kinetics of these hyper-arid soils with those seen in samples from arid and semiarid regions of the Atacama Desert, and data obtained by Viking LRx in the Martian regolith. 13 Carbon- labeled organic compounds (sodium formate, D-, and L-alanine) were added in aqueous solution to different soil samples in order to analyze the evolved carbon dioxide ( 13 CO 2 ) generated during their degradation. As expected, there were significant differences in the evolved gas behavior between soil samples under similar experimental conditions. When sodium formate was added to hyper-arid samples, there was a peak of 13 CO 2 gas released demonstrating high oxidation activity in the soil. Heat treatment of soil samples did not completely eliminate the CO 2 production. An increase in the decomposition rates ∼7 days after the first addition of organics showed a response consistent with biological activity. The addition of D- and L-alanine demonstrated that the production of 13 CO 2 due to biological decomposition began 5-8 days after incubation. Our results suggest that these soils from Pampas de La Joya present at least two types of oxidants, a thermostable one which is highly oxidative and survives heat-treatment, and other thermolabile oxidant which has light or moderate oxidizing activity and does not survives to the heat-treatment. So far the nature of oxidant(s) present in these soils is still unknown. © 2011 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Depending on the specific image modality, we have to consider limitations such as the presence of noise, vanished edges, or high intensity differences, known, in most cases, as inhomogeneities. New algorithms in segmentation are required to provide a better performance. This paper presents a new unified approach to improve traditional segmentation methods as Active Shape Models and Chan-Vese model based on level set. The approach introduces a combination of local analysis implementations with classic segmentation algorithms that incorporates local texture information given by the Hermite transform and Local Binary Patterns. The mixture of both region-based methods and local descriptors highlights relevant regions by considering extra information which is helpful to delimit structures. We performed segmentation experiments on 2D images including midbrain in Magnetic Resonance Imaging and heart’s left ventricle endocardium in Computed Tomography. Quantitative evaluation was obtained with Dice coefficient and Hausdorff distance measures. Results display a substantial advantage over the original methods when we include our characterization schemes. We propose further research validation on different organ structures with promising results."

Areas of study include direct degassing of the magma through the conduit, the interaction between the hydrothermal system and volcanic gases and fluids, and diffuse degassing through the volcanic edifice. Various aspects of the degassing processes of Popocatépetl and Volcán de Colima in Mexico have been studied. The results are summarized in this chapter, and new data on diffuse degassing at both volcanoes and analyses of fumarolic gases from Volcán de Colima are presented. Variations in the flux of SO2 at both volcanoes have led to models of the degassing processes. At Colima, isotopic analyses of condensates suggest a shallow degassing magma body. Volcán de Colima showed geochemical precursors prior to its 1998/9 eruption and variations in certain parameters continue to relate to the behaviour of the volcano during its on-going eruption. Both volcanoes yield interesting data on their diffuse degassing of CO2 and radon: at Popocatépetl, the large plume degassing contrasts with a small diffuse contribution. Volcán de Colima has anomalous concentrations of diffuse CO2 associated with faults. The challenge is how to interpret the geochemical data to provide a fresh insight into the mechanics of the volcanic system."

The analysis focuses on the,performance of the upstream channel, which is the limiting factor of community antenna television (CATV) networks and is critical in the delivery of services to individual subscribers on demand. Simulation results indicated that such streams, within the given protocol limitations, can be supported for a particular system population with trade-offs in terms of system throughput and channel utilization. Network capacity, in terms of the number of simultaneous streams supported and link utilization, is significantly affected by packet size. Analysis of the results indicated that for different streams, packet sizes and combined with header suppression, the benefits from the use of fixed access is essential for the support of timing critical services."

However, it is based on an antipodal way of thinking to what leads to constrained minimization methods. Instead of adapting unconstrained minimization algorithms to handling constraints, it adapts feasibility-seeking algorithms to reduce (not necessarily minimize) target function values. This is done by inserting target-function-reducing perturbations into a feasibility-seeking algorithm while retaining its feasibility-seeking ability and without paying a high computational price. A superiorized algorithm that employs component-wise target function reduction steps is presented. This enables derivative-free superiorization (DFS), meaning that superiorization can be applied to target functions that have no calculable partial derivatives or subgradients. The numerical behavior of our derivative-free superiorization algorithm is illustrated on a data set generated by simulating a problem of image reconstruction from projections. We present a tool (we call it a proximity-target curve) for deciding which of two iterative methods is better for solving a particular problem. The plots of proximity-target curves of our experiments demonstrate the advantage of the proposed derivative-free superiorization algorithm."

Being developed for a microsatellite. This project is being developed with the joint efforts of the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, the Federal Russian Space Agency and the cooperation of some other academic institutions in Mexico. The development of this satellite has academic research purposes, and to settle the grounds of the aerospace sector in the University. The satellite system consists of an atmospheric monitoring system and a set of 2 cameras. Which is the center of the hardware development. The philosophy around these designs is based on fault-proof criteria. Having the optics developed, a CMOS sensor was chosen and the whole system for the storage and transmission of images is being designed, using an FPGA for this process, an array of memories and the transmission of the raw data being handled by the on board computer, the information will be later processed back in a terrestrial station. My personal contribution is the analysis of the electrical requirements of the whole system, design a space grade power system capable of provide energy to the whole system meeting certain standards of quality, as well as design the distribution and consume of such energy. The system's source is planned to be a photovoltaic panels mounted with a control system. The different components of this module meet different needs, which my system must provide, such as different currents, voltages and power consumption patterns. The idea behind this analysis is to create a power consumption efficient system under a scheme that can be replicated in the other modules and in other projects.

The concept of problem field refers to a sequence of related problems. The relationship between the problems assures that their successive solution promotes deep learning of the topic (sequence problems). We define four relations between the field's problems: difficulty and rule, question or property preservation. The problem's difficulty is given by problem-type, algebraic complexity and difficulties of the problem's question and rule used for solution. A problem field based on difficulty will modify one of the above elements in order to get new problems from existing ones. In rule- and property-preserving generation the field's problems differ in their type or difficulty level. In question preserving generation the problems maintain the initial problem's unknown. Once the details of the change are established the new problem will be generated using templates, rules and examples. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

However, the enormous quantity of genes and the few samples to be analyzed affect the performance of any classifier. For this reason, it is necessary to develop a methodology that combines a robust feature selection technique with a classification algorithm for classifying DNA microarrays. In this paper, we combine a feature selection technique based on the Artificial Bee Colony algorithm with an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Furthermore, this ANN is automatically designed by a Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm that optimizes the synaptic weights, the architecture, and the transfer functions at the same time. To test the accuracy of the proposed methodology, we use the Leukemia AML-ALL dataset. © 2017 IEEE."

In this paper we present a methodology that automatically designs an ANN using particle swarm optimization algorithms such as Basic Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Second Generation of Particle Swarm Optimization (SGPSO), and a New Model of PSO called NMPSO. The aim of these algorithms is to evolve, at the same time, the three principal components of an ANN: the set of synaptic weights, the connections or architecture, and the transfer functions for each neuron. Eight different fitness functions were proposed to evaluate the fitness of each solution and find the best design. These functions are based on the mean square error (MSE) and the classification error (CER) and implement a strategy to avoid overtraining and to reduce the number of connections in the ANN. In addition, the ANN designed with the proposed methodology is compared with those designed manually using the well-known Back-Propagation and Levenberg-Marquardt Learning Algorithms. Finally, the accuracy of the method is tested with different nonlinear pattern classification problems. © 2015 Beatriz A. Garro and Roberto A. Vázquez."

We report an experiment on detection and correction of Spanish malapropisms. Malapropos words semantically destroy collocations (syntactically connected word pairs) they are in. Thus we detect possible malapropisms as words that do not form semantically plausible collocations with neighboring words. As correction candidates, we select words similar to the suspected one but forming plausible collocations with neighboring words. To judge semantic plausibility of a collocation, we use Google statistics of occurrences of the word combination and of the two words taken apart. Since collocation components can be separated by other words in a sentence, Google statistics is gathered for the most probable distance between them. The statistics is recalculated to a specially defined Semantic Compatibility Index (SCI). Heuristic rules are proposed to signal malapropisms when SCI values are lower than a predetermined threshold and to retain a few highly SCI-ranked correction candidates. Our experiments gave promising results."

The proposed approach works for open and closed perfectly symmetrical or quasi-symmetrical 2D curves. Simple operations on the SCC and its invariant properties are central to our methodology. To evaluate the proposed methodology, we use 1400 curves from a public database. For the symmetrical/asymmetrical classification task, a recall (R) of 0.86, a balanced accuracy (BA) of 0.92, and a precision (P) of 0.87 were obtained. For the quasi-symmetrical/quasi-asymmetrical classification task, R=0.77, BA=0.83, and P=0.70 were obtained. For the order of rotational symmetry detection task, the following performance was achieved: R=0.97, BA=0.98, and P=0.95 for a symmetrical set of curves, and R=0.98, BA=0.98, and P=0.90 for a quasi-symmetrical set of curves.

Several ANN computational models based on the Levenberg–Marquardt optimization algorithm, and the hyperbolic tangent sigmoid and linear transfer functions were evaluated. Two ANN models (ANN1 and ANN2, characterized by using five and six input variables, respectively; and a common structure of 9 neurons in the hidden layer) were found to be the most suitable architectures for a reliable determination of geothermal pressure gradients. These ANN models used a limited number of input variables which are commonly available in field measurements (e.g., wellbore production data: pressure, temperature and mass flow rate; and wellbore geometry data). Such ANN models were effectively trained by using a wellbore production database which was compiled from several world geothermal fields. Additional wellbore simulation works were also carried out by using the same production data and a numerical simulator (GEOWELLLS). The pressure gradients predicted by using all these computing tools (ANNs and GEOWELLS) were statistically compared with measured field data. From this matching analysis, it was demonstrated that the ANN2 model provided the most acceptable results (with average prediction errors less than 2.3%) in comparison with those results inferred from ANN1 and GEOWELL tools. Details of the computational methodology developed in this study, as well as the numerical validation, and the comparative statistical analysis are comprehensively described."

It is implemented with a new extended version of the computational model of creativity known as Engagement-Reflection. That is, this model simulates adaptation as a creative activity. We introduce here the implementation of our model on an agent that is initialized with basic reflex conducts and that through the interaction with a 3D virtual world, it is able to build new behaviors autonomously. The new acquired skills, according to Piaget's theory, are typically observed in children that have reached the second substage of the sensorimotor period. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The first part of the article discusses an urban atmospheric monitoring system, with special interest in PM2.5 and PM10 particles because of their negative effect on human health and because they degrade the characteristics of optical communication. Its advantages and disadvantages are then analyzed, and it is shown that local monitoring is necessary. A new technical setup is proposed, based on the attenuation of the output optical signal as it is transmitted through open space. The data of official information sources, observational data bases, and interactive maps of the Sistema Nacional de Informacion de la Calidad del Aire and preliminary results of experiments are used to implement the work.

The work is inspired by the problem posed to acquire enough data, in order to train service robots, with the goal of improving the range of objects in the environment with which they can interact. The tool provides a framework that allows users to easily setup different environments with the visual information needed for the training, accordingly to their needs. The tool was developed with the Unity engine, and it was designed to be able to import external prefabs. These models are standardized and catalogued into lists, which are accessed to create more complex and diverse virtual environments. Another component of the tool adds an additional layer of complexity by creating randomized environments with different conditions (scale, position and orientation of objects, and environmental illumination). The performance of the created dataset was tested by training the information on the YOLO-V3 (You Only Look Once) architecture and testing on both artificial and real images."

Characterization of multiphase dispersions is required as it determines mass transfer efficiency and bioreactor homogeneity. It is also needed for the appropriate design of contacting equipment, helping in establishing optimum operational conditions. This work describes the development of image analysis based techniques with advantages (in terms of data acquisition and processing), for the characterization of oil drops and bubble diameters in complex simulated fermentation broths. The system consists of fully digital acquisition of in situ images obtained from the inside of a mixing tank using a CCD camera synchronized with a stroboscopic light source, which are processed with a versatile commercial software. To improve the automation of particle recognition and counting, the Hough transform (HT) was used, so bubbles and oil drops were automatically detected and the processing time was reduced by 55% without losing accuracy with respect to a fully manual analysis. The system has been used for the detailed characterization of a number of operational conditions, including oil content, biomass morphology, presence of surfactants (such as proteins) and viscosity of the aqueous phase. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Inter-plane particle identification is accomplished via 3D tracking algorithms. The multiple plane observation is achieved using a piezoelectric device to make the microscope objective oscillate vertically, while a high-speed camera captures images. The droplet evaporation process lasts several minutes and greatly accelerates as the fluid advances toward complete evaporation. In order to capture the dynamics of the whole process, two cameras with the same optical output but different temporal resolution are used sequentially. Using image processing algorithms, we obtain the full trajectories of multiple tracers, velocities of particles on the free surface of the droplets, and velocity fields.

The watermark is a 1-D binary pseudo-random pattern generated by a secret key which is embedded into the magnitude of the DFT middle frequencies of the original image in order to preserve a high quality perception. To increase security of the watermark, data bits are scrambled using a secret key. During the extraction stage, watermark data bits are extracted, re-arranged with the same secret key used in the embedding process and detected using the bit error rate (BER) criteria. The watermarked image quality is measured using the Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM). The experimental results show the watermark robustness against Rotation, Scaling and Translation (RST) geometric distortions and some common signal processing operations, including DICOM compression schemes, additive Gaussian and impulsive noise, Gaussian and median filtering, sharpness, contrast and brightness changes."

The results show a certain ingredient of subjectivity implicitly contained in these data: we get an average accuracy of 93.04% for the former and 83.31% for the latter. These findings suggest that observers see different things when looking at the samples in the microscope; a situation that significantly diminishes the performance of these classifiers in diagnosing such a disease. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The model takes into account ideas from the study of human-human dialogue in order to define a flexible mechanism for coherent dialogues that may help in the design of effective and user-friendly computer dialogue systems. The main feature of the model is to present an action view of dialogue. CGS model dialogue as an inter-action, this is a sequence of acts performed by two or more agents in a common environment. We claim that CGS are able to model dialogue with a high degree of flexibility, what means that they are able to accept new concepts and modify rules, protocols and settings during the computation."

A hybrid domain for embedding the same watermark is used in this algorithm, which is composed by a couple of watermarking techniques based on spread spectrum and frequency domain. The visual quality is measured by three metrics called Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) and Visual Information Fidelity (VIF). The difference color between the original and watermarked image is computed using the Normalized Color Difference (NCD) measure. Experimentation shows that the proposed method provides high robustness against several geometric distortions including large image cropping, removal attacks, image replacement and affine transformation; signal processing operations including several image filtering, JPEG lossy compression, visual watermark added and noisy image, as well as combined distortions between all of them. Also, we present a comparison with some previously published methods which reported outstanding results and have a similar purpose as our proposal, i.e. They are focused in robust watermarking."

DEMs are digital representations of the Earth's surface. Generally speaking a DEM is generated as a uniform rectangular grid organized in profiles. In order to analyze DEM data by means of binary morphology, the models are represented as binary solids composed of regular polyhedrons (voxels). In the content of this work, we use morphological operators to erode DEMs, simplify binary solid data, preserve essential shape characteristics, understand shape in terms of a decomposition, and identify object features. This is shown by means of some simple examples. We define the contact surface area for DEMs composed of voxels. The contact surface area corresponds to the sum of the contact surface areas of the neighboring voxels of DEMs. A relation between the area of the surface enclosing the volume and the contact surface area is presented. The definition of contact surface area permits us to obtain a fast and efficient method for plotting models composed of a large number of voxels. © 1998 Academic Press."

In this paper we present Disagree, a different data acquisition method to retrieve data in WSNs that works in the opposite way as compared with traditional methods. In Disagree, only nodes that do not satisfy an assertion are required to transmit data back to the sink node in order to obtain a complete view of the network. We show that this behavior is the base of an energy-efficient way to gather all data. An important feature of Disagree is that it saves energy at the sensor level by exploiting data correlation. Rather than requesting explicit data readings from all sensor nodes, Disagree estimates the readings from sensor nodes that did not respond to the assertion. As a result of this policy, Disagree can obtain a view of the sensing field with different levels of resolution involving the transmission of only a subset of the sensor nodes by exploiting spatial data redundancy. We implemented Disagree in NS-2 network simulator and results indicate Disagree can significantly reduce the percentage of nodes replying to queries compared with flat and a cluster head based approaches."

Knots which are digitalized and represented by the orthogonal direction change chain code are called discrete knots. Discrete knots are composed of constant straight-line segments using only orthogonal directions. The chain elements represent the orthogonal direction changes of the constant straight-line segments of the discrete knot. There are only five possible orthogonal direction changes for representing any discrete knot. Thus, this chain code only considers relative direction changes, which allows us to have a unique knot descriptor invariant under translation and rotation. Also, this knot descriptor may be starting point normalized. Finally, this unique knot descriptor produces a numerical string of finite length over a finite alphabet, allows us the usage of grammatical techniques for discrete-knot analysis. Thus, we present some prime discrete knot detection examples within composite discrete knots."

The study is based on two corpora in order to assess the discriminatory capacity of the fundamental frequency and the three first vocalic formants acoustic parameters for reading and semi-spontaneous speech. We found that the context /sa/ has 73% of discriminatory capacity to classify speakers using the three first formants of the vowel /a/ with a dynamic analysis. We used several statistical techniques and found that the best methodology for the recognition of patterns consists of using linear regression with a quadratic fitting to reduce the number of predictors to a manageable level and apply discriminant analysis on the reduced set. This result is consistent with previous research data despite the methodology for Mexican Spanish had never been used."

We found that the context /sa/ has 73% of discriminatory capacity to classify speakers using the three first formants of the vowel /a/ with a dynamic analysis. We used several statistical techniques and found that the best methodology for the recognition of patterns consists of using linear regression with a quadratic fitting to reduce the number of predictors to a manageable level and apply discriminant analysis on the reduced set. This result is consistent with previous research data despite the methodology for Mexican Spanish had never been used."

First, each sentence is divided into elementary discourse units and, then, less informative segments are deleted. To analyze the results, we have set up an annotation campaign, thanks to which we have found interesting aspects regarding the elimination of discourse segments as an alternative to sentenc compression task. Results show that the degree of disagreement in determining the optimal compressed sentence is high and increases with the complexity of the sentence. However, there is some agreement on the decision to delete discourse segments. The informativeness of each segment is calculated using textual energy, a method that has shown good results in automatic summarization."

This paper investigates three related agreement problems, namely consensus, interactive consistency, and k-set agreement, in the context of the condition-based approach. In consensus, processes have to agree on one of the proposed values; in interactive consistency, they have to agree on the vector of proposed values; in k-set agreement, each process decides on one of the proposed values, and at most k different values can be decided on. For both consensus and interactive consistency, a direct correlation between these problems and error correcting codes is established. In particular, crash failures in distributed agreement problems correspond to erasure failures in error correcting codes, and Byzantine and value domain faults correspond to corruption errors. It is also shown that less restrictive codes can be used to solve k-set agreement, but without a necessity proof, which is still an open problem. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2002."

The network is described by a unit distance graph whose vertices are points on the plane two of which are connected if their distance is at most one. The goal of this paper is to design local distributed solutions that require a constant number of communication rounds, independently of the network size or diameter. This is achieved through a combination of distributed computing and computational complexity tools. Starting with a unit distance graph, the paper shows: 1. How to extract a triangulated planar spanner; 2. Several algorithms are proposed to construct spanning trees of the triangulation. Also, it is described how to construct three spanning trees of the Delaunay, triangulation having pairwise empty intersection, with high probability. These algorithms are interesting in their own right, since trees are a popular structure used by many network algorithms; 3. A load balanced distributed storage strategy on top of the trees is presented, that spreads replicas of delta stored in the hosts in a way that the difference between the number of replicas stored by any two hosts is small. Each of the algorithms presented is local, and hence so is the final distributed storage solution, obtained by composing all of them. This implies that the solution adapts very quickly, in constant time, to network topology changes. We present a thorough experimental evaluation of each of the algorithms supporting our claims."

The advantage of the round-by-round approach is that invariants established in the first round are preserved in later rounds. An elegant asynchronous round-by-round shared memory model, is the iterated snapshots model (IS). Instead of the snapshots model where processes share an array m[.] that can be accessed any number of times, indexed by process ID, where P-i writes to m,[i] and can take a snapshot of the entire array, we have processes share a two-dimensional array m[., .], indexed by iteration number and by process ID, where P-i in iteration r writes once to m[r, i] and takes one snapshot of row r, m[r, .]. The IS model lends itself more easily to combinatorial analysis. However, to show that whenever a task is impossible in the IS model the task is impossible in the snapshots model, a simulation is needed. Such a simulation was presented by Borowsky and Gafni in PODC97; namely, it was shown how to take a wait-free protocol for the snapshots model, and transform it into a protocol for the IS model, solving the same task. In this paper we present a new simulation from the snapshots model to the IS model, and show that it; can be extended to work with models stronger that wait-free. The main contribution is to show that the simulation can work with models that have access to certain communication objects, called 01-tasks. This extends the result of Gafni, Rajsbaum and Herlihy in DISC'2006 stating that renaming is strictly weaker than set agreement from the IS model to the usual non-iterated wait-free read/write shared memory model. We also show that our simulation works with t-resilient models and the more general dependent process failure model of Junqueira and Marzullo. This version of the simulation extends previous results by Herlihy and Rajsbaum in PODC'2010 and DISC'2010 about the topological connectivity of a protocol complex in an iterated dependent process failure model, to the corresponding non-iterated model."

Known transcriptional regulators associated with this process are called xenogeneic silencers (XS) and belong to either the H-NS, Lsr2, MvaT or Rok families. In the work described here we looked for XS-like regulators and their distribution in prokaryotic organisms was evaluated. Our analysis showed that putative XS regulators similar to H-NS, Lsr2, MvaT or Rok are present only in bacteria (31.7%). This does not exclude the existence of alternative XS in the rest of the organisms analyzed. Additionally, of the four XS groups evaluated in this work, those from the H-NS family have diversified more than the other groups. In order to compare the distribution of these putative XS regulators we also searched for other nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs) not included in this group such as Fis, EbfC/YbaB, HU/IHF and Alba. Results showed that NAPs from the Fis, EbfC/YbaB, HU/IHF and Alba families are widely (94%) distributed among prokaryotes. These NAPs were found in multiple combinations with or without XS-like proteins. In regard with XS regulators, results showed that only XS proteins from one family were found in those organisms containing them. This suggests specificity for this type of regulators and their corresponding genomes."

14130,Does the principle of computational equivalence overcome the objections against computationalism?,2012,Francisco Hernández Quiroz,Facultad de Ciencias,,9781908187246,,10.1007/978-3-642-37225-4_14,http://gordana.se/work/PUBLICATIONS-files/2012-NaturalComputingProceedings-AISB-IACAPWorldCongress2012.pdf#page=62,TC,Philosophy,Computationalism ;Computational Theory of Mind ;Representationalism ;Principle of Computational Equivalence,"Computationalism has been variously defined as the idea that the human mind can be modelled by means of mechanisms broadly equivalent to Turing Machines. Computationalism’s claims have been hotly debated and arguments against and for have drawn extensively from mathematics, cognitive sciences and philosophy, although the debate is hardly settled. On the other hand, in his 2002 book New Kind of Science, Stephen Wolfram advanced what he called the Principle of Computational Equivalence (PCE), whose main contention is that fairly simple systems can easily reach very complex behaviour and become as powerful as any possible system based on rules (that is, they are computationally equivalent). He also claimed that any natural (and even human) phenomenon can be explained as the interaction of very simple rules. Of course, given the universality of Turing Machine-like mechanisms, PCE could be considered simply a particular brand of computationalism, subject to the same objections as previous attempts. In this paper we analyse in depth if this view of PCE is justified or not and hence if PCE can overcome some criticisms and be a different and better model of the human mind."
14131,Dopaminergic modulation of the striatal microcircuit: Receptor-specific configuration of cell assemblies,2011,José Bargas Díaz,Instituto de Fisiología Celular (IFC),,,,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3226-11.2011,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-80054735833&doi=10.1523%2fJNEUROSCI.3226-11.2011&partnerID=40&md5=4c80d68e8ceededd3ace04344475d41c,RS,Computational Biology,,"Selection and inhibition of motor behaviors are related to the coordinated activity and compositional capabilities of striatal cell assemblies. Striatal network activity represents a main step in basal ganglia processing. The dopaminergic system differentially regulates distinct populations of striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) through the activation of D 1-or D 2-type receptors. Although postsynaptic and presynaptic actions of these receptors are clearly different in MSNs during cell-focused studies, their activation during network activity has shown inconsistent responses. Therefore, using electrophysiological techniques, functional multicell calcium imaging, and neuronal population analysis in rat corticostriatal slices,wedescribe the effect of selective dopaminergic receptor activation in the striatal network by observing cell assembly configurations. At the microcircuit level, during striatal network activity, the selective activation of either D 1-or D 2-type receptors is reflected as overall increases in neuronal synchronization. However, graph theory techniques applied to the transitions between network states revealed receptor-specific configurations of striatal cell assemblies: D 1 receptor activation generated closed trajectories with high recurrence and few alternate routes favoring the selection of specific sequences, whereas D 2 receptor activation created trajectories with low recurrence and more alternate pathways while promoting diverse transitions among neuronal pools. At the single-cell level, the activation of dopaminergic receptors enhanced the negative-slope conductance region (NSCR) in D 1-type-responsive cells, whereas in neurons expressing D 2-type receptors, the NSCR was decreased. Consequently, receptor-specific network dynamics most probably result from the interplay of postsynaptic and presynaptic dopaminergic actions."

In order to accomplish this study, an experimental blood flow phantom was constructed. This is a controlled platform that allows to generate a range of blood flow profiles, and also to produce different degree of stenosis on a testing vessel. The phantom has also been electrically modeled in order to asses the response under conditions both normal and pathological (with stenosis). The flow average velocity is estimated by calculating the Pseudo Instantaneous Mean Frequency (PIMF) of a discrete Doppler ultrasound signal produced with a blood flow phantom. This signal is conditioned, digitized and processed in order to generate a 2-D spectrogram to be displayed and for calculating suitable clinical parameters like flow, pulsatile index and resistance index, among others. A graphical user interface (GUI) has been developed for input, output and set control variables and monitoring the system. The results in this study demonstrate a suitable use of Doppler ultrasound spectral analysis of blood flow in order to evaluate the degree of stenosis in vessels."

Classification using ensemble methods may contribute to improving reliability using the proper 2D and 3D images of spine curvature features. In this study, we present two new techniques to describe the spine, namely, leave-one-out and fan leave-one-out. Using these techniques, three descriptors are computed from a stereoradiographic 3D reconstruction to describe the relationship between a vertebra and its neighbors. A dynamic ensemble selection method is introduced for automatic spine classification. The performance of the method is evaluated on a dataset containing 962 3D spine models categorized according to three curve types. With a log loss of 0.5623, the dynamic ensemble selection outperforms voting and stacking ensemble learning techniques. This method can improve intraobserver and interobserver reliability, identify the best combination of descriptors for characterizing spine curve types, and provide assistance to clinicians in the form of information to classify borderline curvature types."

The P-GW connects the UE to the external networks. The sessions are created between the User Equipment (UE) and the P-GW via Serving Gateway (S-GW). The MME selects the P-GW and the S-GW for the sessions and handles the control signaling. Multiple P-GWs handle these packets and transfer them to the external packet data networks. Thus, based on how the sessions are established, different gateways may have to handle different amount of load. If proper load balancing algorithms are not used, the load on some gateways may be higher than others leading to Quality of Service (QoS) degradation for the users. We propose a Linear Programming formulation of the problem and four different heuristics: Load Balancing Threshold (LBT); Static APN Associated Weights (SAAW); Dynamic Weights (DW); and Entropy Based Assignment (EBA). The entropy function provides an accurate measure of the difference in the load on the gateways. It measures the uncertainty or randomness in the outcome of an experiment. The performance studies show that the EBA algorithm provides 18% performance improvement for networks consisting of 1,00,000 users, 12 APNs and 50 P-GWs."

Specifically, we show how language change can be explained by using a new variant of membrane systems: Dynamic Meaning Membrane Systems (DMMS). By using DMMS, we model the main concepts of semantics and explain the three basic types of changes in meaning: broadening, narrowing and shift. Finally, we relate the membrane systems' application to language evolution with the suggested application of the so-called cultural grammar systems to the same topic. Collaboration between the two frameworks may provide a useful formalism that, due to its naturalness and simplicity, might offer interesting results in a discipline traditionally far away from any formalization."

In particular, when an object under processing is too big or too heavy, a single robot may not be enough to handle it. Two or more manipulators are to be used in such a case. This paper presents the study of the dynamic equations for two industrial robots holding a rigid object. To this end, holonomic constraints are combined with the manipulators and object equations of motion to obtain the dynamic model of the whole system, which can be used for simulation purposes. Experimental results are presented to validate the theoretical results. © 2005 Cambridge University Press."

The blockage at the early B lymphoid cell development pathway within the bone marrow is tightly associated with hematopoietic and immune diseases, where the disruption of basal regulatory networks prevents the continuous replenishment of functional B cells. Dynamic computational models may be instrumental for the comprehensive understanding of mechanisms underlying complex differentiation processes and provide novel prediction/intervention platforms to reinvigorate the system. Methods. By reconstructing a three-module regulatory network including genetic transcription, intracellular transduction, and microenvironment communication, we have investigated the early B lineage cell fate decisions in normal and pathological settings. The early B cell differentiation network was simulated as a Boolean model and then transformed, using fuzzy logic, to a continuous model. We tested null and overexpression mutants to analyze the emergent behavior of the network. Due to its importance in inflammation, we investigated the effect of NFkB induction at different early B cell differentiation stages. Results. While the exhaustive synchronous and asynchronous simulation of the early B cell regulatory network (eBCRN) reproduced the configurations of the hematopoietic progenitors and early B lymphoid precursors of the pathway, its simulation as a continuous model with fuzzy logics suggested a transient IL-7R+ ProB-to-Pre-B subset expressing pre-BCR and a series of dominant B-cell transcriptional factors. This conspicuous differentiating cell population up-regulated CXCR7 and reduced CXCR4 and FoxO1 expression levels. Strikingly, constant but intermediate NFkB signaling at specific B cell differentiation stages allowed stabilization of an aberrant CXCR7+ pre-B like phenotype with apparent affinity to proliferative signals, while under constitutive overactivation of NFkB, such cell phenotype was aberrantly exacerbated from the earliest stage of common lymphoid progenitors. Our mutant models revealed an abnormal delay in the BCR assembly upon NFkB activation, concomitant to sustained Flt3 signaling, down-regulation of Ebf1, Irf4 and Pax5 genes transcription, and reduced Ig recombination, pointing to a potential lineage commitment blockage. Discussion. For the first time, an inducible CXCR7hi B cell precursor endowed with the potential capability of shifting central lymphoid niches, is inferred by computational modeling. Its phenotype is compatible with that of leukemia-initiating cells and might be the foundation that bridges inflammation with blockage-related malignancies and a wide range of immunological diseases. Besides the predicted differentiation impairment, inflammation-inducible phenotypes open the possibility of newly formed niches colonized by the reported precursor. Thus, emergent bone marrow ecosystems are predicted following a pro-inflammatory induction, that may lead to hematopoietic instability associated to blockage pathologies.

While this problem is impossible to solve in asynchronous systems prone to process crash failures, it can be solved in synchronous (round-based) systems where all but one process might crash in any execution. It is well-known that   (t+1)  rounds are necessary and sufficient in the worst case execution scenario for the processes to decide and stop executing, where   t<n  is a system parameter denoting the maximum number of allowed process crashes and n denotes the number of processes in the system. Early decision and stopping considers the case where   f<t  processes actually crash, f not being known by processes. It has been shown that the number of rounds that have to be executed in the worst case is then   min(f+2,t+1) . Following Castañeda, Gonczarowski and Moses (DISC 2014), the paper shows that this value is an upper bound attained only in worst execution scenarios. To this end, it investigates a sequence of three early deciding/stopping predicates   P1=Pcount ,   P2=Pdif  and   P3=Ppref0 , of increasing power, which differ in the information obtained by the processes from the actual failure, communication and data pattern. It is shown that each predicate   Pi  is better than the previous one   Pi−1 ,   i∈{2,3} , in the sense that there are executions where   Pi  allows processes to reach a decision earlier than   Pi−1 , while   Pi−1  never allows a process to decide earlier than   Pi . Moreover,   P3=Ppref0  is an unbeatable predicate in the sense that it cannot be strictly improved: if there is an early deciding/stopping predicate   P′  that improves the decision time of a process with respect to   Ppref0  in a given execution, then there is at least one execution in which a process decides with   P′  strictly later than with   Ppref0 ."

Flow fields revealed the occurrence of reflux regions in the beginning, being this effect stronger at low entrance pressure, which could be related to abnormal swallowing. As a consequence, the bolus travels preferably along the walls. It has been also observed that the bolus head travels faster than the bolus tail, which indicates that the bolus is elongated. Results from this work can be further used for a rheological characterization of oral nutritional supplements for patients suffering from swallowing disorders. Practical Applications: The flow through the pharynx has been numerically investigated with a non-Newtonian fluid to get insight about causes leading to abnormal swallowing. Reflux has been observed in the beginning as result of a central stream and two symmetric loops generated along the walls, being this effect at low peristaltic pressure.

We summarize the literature on the subject identifying three main narratives: ecosystem properties that enable them to be more resilient; ecosystem response to perturbations; and complexity. We also include original ideas with theoretical and quantitative developments with application examples. The main contribution is a new way to rethink resilience, that is mathematically formal and easy to evaluate heuristically in real-world applications: ecosystem antifragility. An ecosystem is antifragile if it benefits from environmental variability. Antifragility therefore goes beyond robustness or resilience because while resilient/robust systems are merely perturbation-resistant, antifragile structures not only withstand stress but also benefit from it."

The polynomial transform is an image description model which incorporates important properties of visual perception, such as the Gaussian-derivative model of early vision. The polynomial transform basically consists of a local description of an image. Localization is achieved by multiplying the image with overlapping window functions. In the case of the discrete polynomial transform, the contents of the image within every position of the analysis window is represented by a finite set of coefficients. These coefficients correspond to the weights in a polynomial expansion that reconstructs the image within the window function. It has been showed how the polynomial transform can be used to design efficient noise-reduction algorithms by adaptively transforming the coefficients of every window according to the image contents1. Other types of transformations on the polynomial coefficents lead to different image-restoration applications, such as deblurring, coding, and interpolation2. In all cases, the restored image is obtained by means of an inverse polynomial transform which consists of interpolating the transformed coefficients with pattern functions that are products of a polynomial and a window function. We show in this paper how image restoration, namely noise reduction and deblurring, based on the polynomial transform can be improved by detecting the position and orientation of relevant edges in the image. © 1996 SPIE.

A basic conviction in computational biology is that it should be possible to develop computational tools allowing us to considerably increase our understanding of such functional properties. Understanding a fragment of reality is closely related to having a model of such a fragment. Hence, model construction is a high priority on the agenda of computational biology. Once available, a model can then be analyzed with different techniques. These two processes, however, are often intertwined, as analysis can guide the construction of a model"

However, due to co-existing intra-path and inter-path interference in wireless networks, multi-hop forwarding significantly degrades network performance (e.g. throughput, reliability and fairness etc.). In response to this challenge, we propose a unique solution, hybrid TDMA/CSMA, as a medium access control method to effectively handle a wide range of complicated interference scenarios under the impact of dynamic traffic. Our simulation results demonstrate that hybrid TDMA/CSMA significantly reduces packet loss rate, and increases throughput as well as fairness."

We found that the antimodular networks showed similar dynamics to the standard networks. Confirming previous results, modular networks had more complex dynamics. On the other hand, we generated multilayer RBNs where there are different RBNs in the nodes of a higher scale RBN. We observed the dynamics of micro-and macronetworks by adjusting parameters at each scale to reveal how the behavior of lower layers affects the behavior of higher layers and vice versa. We found that the statistical properties of macro-RBNs were changed by the parameters of micro-RBNs, but not the other way around. However, the precise patterns of networks were dominated by the macro-RBNs. In other words, for statistical properties only upward causation was relevant, while for the detailed dynamics downward causation was prevalent."

In this work we apply chain codes to represent object with holes and we compare their compression efficiency for seven chain codes.

The deployment of models to different platforms and different programming languages makes it more imperative to confirm that the models are correct. However, systems are usually composed of concurrent behaviours, which complicates the potential use of model-checking technology. We structure models composed of several finite-state machines into a vector whose execution is a round-robin sequential off-line schedule. This enables model-checking of the requirements. We illustrate this with two case studies widely discussed in the literature. The models can be executed on diverse platforms, and we utilise the same interpreter to generate the corresponding Kripke structure suitable for verification with tools such as NUSMV."

We have previously shown that this methodology is very efficient in producing succinct and clear models (e.g., in contrast to plain finite-state machines, Petri nets, or Behavior Trees). We show that we can capture requirements precisely and that we can simulate and validate the models. We can, therefore, directly apply Model-Driven Engineering and deploy the models into software for diverse platforms with full tractability of requirements. Moreover, the sequential semantics of our vector of finite-state machines enables model-checking, formally establishing the correctness of the model. Finally, our approach facilitates systematic Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) for diverse target platforms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology with several examples widely discussed in the software engineering literature and compare this with other approaches, showing that we can prove more properties, and that some claims about verification in such approaches have been exaggerated or are incomplete."

In this paper we address this question by considering various heuristic strategies for sentinel placement that can potentially be implemented in real-world situations without requiring excessive amounts of computation, or even having perfect data about the structure of the network. We find that strategies that attempt to distribute sentinels over different regions of the network perform best in highly modular or spatially embedded networks, whereas the strategy of targeting the most well connected individuals works best when there is a considerable amount of contact heterogeneity between individuals. Our results may be used as a guideline to help decide when certain strategies should, or should not, be implemented. Surveillance plays a crucial role in preventing emerging infectious diseases from becoming epidemic. In circumstances where it is possible to monitor the infection status of certain people, transport hubs, or hospitals, early detection of the disease allows interventions to be implemented before most of the damage can occur, or at least its impact can be mitigated. This paper addresses the question of which nodes we should select in a network of individuals susceptible to some infectious disease in order to minimize the number of casualties. By simulating disease outbreaks on a collection of empirical and synthetic networks we show that the best strategy depends on topological characteristics of the network. For highly modular or spatially embedded networks it is better to place the sentinels on nodes distributed across different regions. However, if the degree heterogeneity is high, then a strategy that targets network hubs is preferred. We further consider the consequences of having an incomplete sample of the network and demonstrate that the value of new information diminishes as more data is collected. Finally we find further marginal improvements using two heuristics informed by known results in graph theory that exploit the fragmented structure of sparse network data."

The influence of the substituents at the heterocyclic ring was studied in tetrabutylammonium perchlorate by linear and sweep voltamperometry with platinum rotatory disc. Cyclic voltamperometry, controlled potential electrolysis and EPR techniques were used in order to determine the oxidation mechanisms. In acidic medium all derivatives follow an oxidation mechanism with an ECE (Electrochemical, Chemical, Electrochemical process), sequence. On the other hand, in basic media the derivatives obey a DISP1 (Disproportionation) mechanism, whereas the uptake of the proton at N1 by the OH- ion of the medium was the rate determining step. The effect of different substituents in the compounds was studied by using the theoretical ionization potential and the half wave oxidation potential correlation, as. It was found that there is an acceptable relationship between these parameters. copyright The Electrochemical Society."

We study the nematic's director and velocity profiles induced by the imposed Couette flow and an applied radial electric field. We present calculations for the specific flow-aligning nematic liquid crystal 4′ -n -pentyl-4-cyanobiphenyl and numerically solve a hydrodynamic model assuming hard anchoring and nonslip boundary conditions. We calculate a phase diagram in the parameter space showing a region where there exist multiple equilibrium solutions for the nematic's configuration and a region where there exists only one stationary solution. We also study the rheology of the system by calculating the apparent viscosity and the first normal stress difference. We find that the competition between the Couette flow and the electric field gives rise to an interesting non-Newtonian response which switches its behavior from shear thickening to shear thinning by exceeding a critical field. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.

Traditionally, cognitive science had relegated all behavior to being the end result of internal neural activity. However, the role of feedback from the interactions between agent and their environment has become increasingly important to understanding behavior. We focus on the role that social interaction plays in the behavioral and neural activity of the individuals taking part in it. Is social interaction merely a source of complex inputs to the individual, or can social interaction increase the individuals' own complexity? Here we provide a proof of concept of the latter possibility by artificially evolving pairs of simulated mobile robots to increase their neural complexity, which consistently gave rise to strategies that take advantage of their capacity for interaction. We found that during social interaction, the neural controllers exhibited dynamics of higher-dimensionality than were possible in social isolation. Moreover, by testing evolved strategies against unresponsive ghost partners, we demonstrated that under some conditions this effect was dependent on mutually responsive co-regulation, rather than on the mere presence of another agent's behavior as such. Our findings provide an illustration of how social interaction can augment the internal degrees of freedom of individuals who are actively engaged in participation."

Experiments under constrained virtual settings revealed that interaction dynamics implicitly guide social cognition. Here we show that embodied social interaction can be constitutive of agency detection and of experiencing another's presence. Pairs of participants moved their avatars' along an invisible virtual line and could make haptic contact with three identical objects, two of which embodied the other's motions, but only one, the other's avatar, also embodied the other's contact sensor and thereby enabled responsive interaction. Co-regulated interactions were significantly correlated with identifications of the other's avatar and reports of the clearest awareness of the other's presence.

However, the connection between these two important fields just begun recently. It is clear that both are closely related: Mobility generates encounters, and these encounters might give rise to contagion phenomena or even friendship. We model a set of random walkers that visit locations in space following a strategy akin to Lévy flights. We measure the encounters in space and time and establish a link between walkers after they coincide several times. This generates a temporal network that is characterized by global quantities. We compare this dynamics with real data for two cities: New York City and Tokyo. We use data from the location-based social network Foursquare and obtain the emergent temporal encounter network, for these two cities, that we compare with our model. We found long-range (Lévy-like) distributions for traveled distances and time intervals that characterize the emergent social network due to human mobility. Studying this connection is important for several fields like epidemics, social influence, voting, contagion models, behavioral adoption and diffusion of ideas. © 2017 Riascos, Mateos.

In its first version, Dev E-R uses an agent that can see and move its head; through interactions with its environment, it is able to develop elaborated behaviors consistent with Piaget's ideas. This work describes an advancement of our model. We give our agent a hand (tactile sensor) so it can detect the presence and features of an object in its environment; we also study the necessary mechanisms to coordinate its vision with the sense of touch. We report the behavior of the agent when it is granted the capacity of touching without seeing (i.e. the agent was blind) and when both skills, touch and sight, come together. For such purpose, we place an agent in a virtual environment and let it perform in different contexts. We analyze how new knowledge structures results from prior experiences and interactions with the environment. The outcomes from the experiments reveal that it learns new skills associated with eye-hand coordination. We observe that the arising developmental behavior resembles some of the features reported by Jean Piaget."

To the best of our knowledge, no investigations have provided in-depth evidence and discussion on the changes of the endogenous fluorescence in ex vivo tissue due to the effects of the preservation media. In this work, we contrast and analyze the endogenous fluorescence from tryptophan, vitamin A, hydroxyproline and elastin cross-links potential biomarkers of the liver fibrosis, in in vivo measurements and liver samples preserved on formaldehyde, and two standard preservation media. As it is known, chemical changes in tissue, caused by formaldehyde fixation, alter the endogenous fluorescence spectra. We propose the use of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and Iscove’s Modified Dulbecco’s Medium (IMDM) to elude the fluorescence changes. PBS and IMDM showed to maintain the endogenous fluorescence characteristics similar to in vivo conditions. The results of this work point the way for a more reliable assessment of endogenous fluorescence in ex vivo hepatic studies. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."

TEMA is based on distributed elections held among nodes to gain interference-free access to the channel in either unicast or broadcast mode. Non-transmitting nodes can infer whether or not they are the intended receiver of a transmission and act accordingly to save energy, without the need for particular traffic patterns or explicit future transmission schedules. TEMA is shown to be correct in the sense that the channel access schedules are collision-free at the intended receivers, and intended receivers are always in receiving state. An analytical model of the performance of the protocol is used to show that TEMA attains energy-efficiency and high channel utilization even under heavy traffic and high node density conditions. A simulation-based performance analysis validates the analytical results and shows that TEMA outperforms representatives of contention-based and interference-free protocols in terms of energy efficiency, network goodput, and channel access delay. More specifically, it reduces energy consumption to half of that of state-of-the-art distributed election-based protocols while providing up to 25% increase in goodput and up to 50% decrease in channel access delay."

Keeping the symbol with the highest frequency of occurrence as silent during transmission, we achieve substantial savings of transmitter and receiver energies by using a hybrid Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK) - Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) modulation/demodulation technique. Our results show that for channels with Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN), on an average, the transmitter side energy is reduced by about 53%, while at the receiver side there is about 17.2% savings. Due to the savings of transmitter and receiver energies and the low cost/complexity of the proposed transceiver, our proposed scheme is suitable for multi-hop communication in Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs)."

The adjustment for connectivity criteria, as well as other tuning parameters, come from the Nyquist sampling criterion, applied to spatial resolution, and are obtained from biological considerations, such as the average size of a normal cell.

Anticipating non-periodic dynamics is difficult but not impossible because mutual coordination allows for chaotic processes to synchronize to each other and become periodic. A chaotic oscillator with random period and amplitude affords being stabilized onto a periodic trajectory by a weak input if the driver incorporates information about the oscillator. We studied synchronization with predictable and unpredictable stimuli where the unpredictable stimuli could be non-interactive or interactive. The latter condition required learning to control a chaotic system. We expected better overall performance with the predictable but more learning and generalization with unpredictable interactive stimuli. Participants practiced an auditory-motor synchronization task by matching their sonified hand movements to sonified tutors: the Non-Interactive Predictable tutor (NI-P) was a sinusoid, the Non-Interactive Unpredictable (NI-U) was a chaotic system, the Interactive Unpredictable (I-U) was the same chaotic system with an added weak input from the participant's movement. Different pre/post-practice stimuli evaluated generalization. Quick improvement was seen in NIP. Synchronization, dynamic similarity, and causal interaction increased with practice in I-U but not in NI-U. Generalization was seen for few pre-post stimuli in NI-P, none in NI-U, and most stimuli in I-U. Synchronization with novel chaotic dynamics is challenging but mutual interaction enables the behavioral control of such dynamics and the practice of complex motor skills."

Thermodynamically, this increase must be offset by production of entropy which, broadly speaking, can be understood as a decrease in order. Ideally, self-organisation can be used to guide the system towards a desired regime or state, while exporting the entropy to the system's exterior. Thus, Guided Self-Organisation (GSO) attempts to harness the order-inducing potential of self-organisation for specific purposes. Not surprisingly, general methods developed to study entropy can also be applied to guided self-organisation. This special issue covers a broad diversity of GSO approaches which can be classified in three categories: information theory, intelligent agents, and collective behavior. The proposals make another step towards a unifying theory of GSO which promises to impact numerous research fields."

Understanding within a genomic perspective how the transcriptional machinery of bacteria is modulated, as a response for changing conditions, is a major challenge for biologists. Knowledge of which genes are turned on or turned off under specific conditions is essential for our understanding of cell behavior. In this study we describe how the information pertaining to gene expression and associated growth conditions (even with very little knowledge of the associated regulatory mechanisms) is gathered from the literature and incorporated into RegulonDB, a database on transcriptional regulation and operon organization in E. coli. The link between growth conditions, signal transduction, and transcriptional regulation is modeled in the database in a simple format that highlights biological relevant information.

Objectives This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of MSK disorders and rheumatic diseases in eight Latin American indigenous communities, and to identify which factors influence such prevalence using network analysis and syndemic approach. Methods This is a cross-sectional, community-based census study according to Community-Oriented Program for the Control of Rheumatic Diseases methodology. Individuals with MSK pain, stiffness or swelling in the past and/or during the last 7 days were evaluated by participating physicians. A descriptive, univariable and multivariable analysis was performed, followed by a network analysis. Results We surveyed 6155 indigenous individuals with a mean age of 41.2 years (SD 17.6; range 18-105); 3757 (61.0%) were women. Point prevalence in rank order was: low back pain in 821 (13.3%); osteoarthritis in 598 (9.7%); rheumatic regional pain syndromes in 368 (5.9%); rheumatoid arthritis in 85 (1.3%); undifferentiated arthritis in 13 (0.2%); and spondyloarthritis in 12 (0.1%). There were marked variations in the prevalence of each rheumatic disease among the communities. Multivariate models and network analysis revealed a complex relationship between rheumatic diseases, comorbidities and socioeconomic conditions. Conclusions The overall prevalence of MSK disorders in Latin American indigenous communities was 34.5%. Although low back pain and osteoarthritis were the most prevalent rheumatic diseases, wide variations according to population groups occurred. The relationship between rheumatic diseases, comorbidities and socioeconomic conditions allows taking a syndemic approach to the study."

In the past two decades, the so-called 4E approaches to the mind and cognition have been rapidly gaining in recognition and have become an integral part of various disciplines. > Problem . Recently, however, questions have been raised as to whether, and to what degree, these different approaches actually cohere with one another. Specifically, it seems that many of them endorse mutually incompatible, perhaps even contradictory, epistemological and metaphysical presuppositions. > Method . By retracing the roots of an alternative conception of mind and cognition, as propounded by Varela, Thompson & Rosch, we provide an outline of the original philosophical framework of enactivism and neurophenomenology. We focus on its three central tenets - reflexivity, subject-world co-determination, and the construal of cognition as situated, skillful and embodied action - and show how they collectively add up to a radical change in attitude towards the age-old philosophical dilemmas. > Results . We show how contemporary enactivist and embodied approaches relate to the original Varelian conception, and argue that many of them, despite frequent claims to the contrary, adopt significantly less radical philosophical positions. Further, we provide some tentative suggestions as to why this dilution of the original impetus might have occurred, paying special attention to the deep-rooted disparities that span the field. > Implications . It is argued that more attention should be paid to epistemological and metaphysical tenets of different proposals within the 4E movement in general and enactivism in particular. Additionally, in emphasizing the inescapable multilayeredness and contextuality of scientific knowledge, enactivism and neurophenomenology accord with pluralist accounts of science and might provide important contributions to contemporary debates in the field. > Constructivist content . The epistemological odyssey, construed as a journey to find a middle way between realism and idealism, is a central tenet of anti-representationalist, non-dualist constructivist approaches aimed at avoiding age-old philosophical traps."

Such a transform may be used to merge data between these 2 systems, addressing the colourless sparse nature of the lidar data and potentially improving depth estimation from the stereo pairs. The proposed approach features a novel planar calibration object with three circular features allowing for the robust acquisition of corresponding features between sensors. A closed-form registration of correspondences is proposed, leading to the derivation of the required transform. The main appeal of the proposed approach is its conceptually simple formulation and the fact that only a single image from each device is required for calibration. Our experiments were performed on real data captured in outdoor and indoor environments and demonstrate good performance with a Velodyne VLP-16 lidar and GOPRO HERO 3+ Stereo rig."

A number of such algorithms were developed recently. They are all based on three greedy schemes, applied when the forwarding node is able to advance the message toward destination. In this paper we show that the hop count, that is the number of transmissions needed to route a message from a source node to a destination node can be estimated reasonably accurately (in random unit graphs with uniform traffic), with less than 10%, 5% and 7% error for directional (compass), distance (greedy) and progress (MFR) based schemes, respectively, for 100 nodes with average degrees between 5 and 14, without experiments. Our results are derived from statistical observations regarding expected position of forwarding neighbor."

Notwithstanding the recent advances in AP, this is still an unsolved problem, especially in the case of social media domains. According to the literature most of the work has been devoted to the analysis of useful textual features. The most prominent ones are those related with content and style. In spite of the success of using jointly both kinds of features, most of the authors agree in that content features are much more relevant than style, which suggest that some profiling aspects, like age or gender could be determined only by observing the thematic interests, concerns, moods, or others words related to events of daily life. Additionally, most of the research only uses traditional representations such as the BoW, rather than other more sophisticated representations to harness the content features. In this regard, this paper aims at evaluating the usefulness of some topic-based representations for the AP task. We mainly consider a representation based on Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), which automatically discovers the topics from a given document collection, and a simplified version of the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), which consists of 41 features representing manually predefined thematic categories. We report promising results in several corpora showing the effectiveness of the evaluated topic-based representations for AP in social media."

Some caveats of the practical use of the method are addressed.

Transcription factors (TFs) have fundamental roles in controlling these processes. TFs are proteins dedicated to favor and/or impede the activity of the RNA polymerase. In prokaryotes these proteins have been grouped into families that can be found in most of the different taxonomic divisions. In this work, the association between the expansion patterns of 111 protein regulatory families was systematically evaluated in 1351 non-redundant prokaryotic genomes. This analysis provides insights into the functional and evolutionary constraints imposed on different classes of regulatory factors in bacterial and archaeal organisms. Based on their distribution, we found a relationship between the contents of some TF families and genome size. For example, nine TF families that represent 43.7% of the complete collection of TFs are closely associated with genome size; i.e., in large genomes, members of these families are also abundant, but when a genome is small, such TF family sizes are decreased. In contrast, almost 102 families (56.3% of the collection) do not exhibit or show only a low correlation with the genome size, suggesting that a large proportion of duplication or gene loss events occur independently of the genome size and that various yet-unexplored questions about the evolution of these TF families remain. In addition, we identified a group of families that have a similar distribution pattern across Bacteria and Archaea, suggesting common functional and probable coevolution processes, and a group of families universally distributed among all the genomes. Finally, a specific association between the TF families and their additional domains was identified, suggesting that the families sense specific signals or make specific protein-protein contacts to achieve the regulatory roles. © 2020, MDPI AG.

The initial volume of the droplets is in the range from 0.6 to 1.0 μl, and observations were made in the last stages before total evaporation. The flow was recorded in a sequence of images that were analyzed with a micro-PIV system to extract quantitative information. Also, using image analysis techniques we determined the dynamics of the retreating liquid film once unpinned from the original contact line. Additionally, we have explored its correlation to the formation of the sediment pattern which is organized in elongated mounds roughly deposited in azimuthal and radial orientations. It is found that the aggregation dynamics of micro-spheres in the segments of the two orientations is different. This might have a substantial influence on the final arrangement of micro-spheres in the sediments."

Systems modelling involves the processes of structure selection, parameter estimation, model performance and model validation and involves a complex solution space. Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) are search and optimisation tools founded on the principles of natural evolution and genetics, which are suitable for a wide range of application areas. Due to the versatility of these tools and motivated by the versatility of genetic programming (GP), this evolutionary paradigm is proposed for this modelling problem. GP is then combined with a multiobjective function definition scheme. Multiobjective genetic programming (MOGP) is applied to multiple, conflicting objectives and yields a set of candidate parsimonious and valid models, which reproduce the original system behaviour. The MOGP approach is then demonstrated as being applicable for system modelling with chaotic dynamics. The circuit introduced by Chua, being one of the most popular benchmarks for studying nonlinear oscillations, and the Duffing–Holmes oscillator are the systems to test the evolutionary-based modelling approach introduced in this paper.

One of the challenges highlighted by the hydrology and related communities is the need for more open data and monitoring of floods in space and time. In this paper, we present the development phases and experiments of an Internet of Things (IoT)-based wireless sensor network for hydrometeorological data collection and flood monitoring for the urban area of Colima-Villa de alvarez in Mexico. The network is designed to collect fluvial water level, soil moisture and weather parameters that are transferred to the server and to a web application in real-time using IoT Message Queuing Telemetry Transport protocol over 3G and Wi-Fi networks. The network is tested during three different events of tropical storms that occurred over the area of Colima during the 2019 tropical cyclones season. The results show the ability of the smart water network to collect real-time hydrometeorological information during extreme events associated with tropical storms. The technology used for data transmission and acquisition made it possible to collect information at critical times for the city. Additionally, the data collected provided essential information for implementing and calibrating hydrological models and hydraulic models to generate flood inundation maps and identify critical infrastructure."

We consider multiple users subscribe to a video streaming service, and request videos encoded in H.264 Scalable Video Coding format. The scheduler maximizes the average video quality across all users by assigning resource blocks based on their device capabilities, link qualities, and available resources. We measure video quality using two full reference metrics: peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity (SSIM) index. We formulate the video delivery problem first as an integer linear program (ILP), and then reduce it to the multiple choice knapsack problem (MCKP). To solve the MCKP, we propose two fast heuristics with reduced processing overhead at the eNodeB, and a fully polynomial-time approximate scheme (FPTAS) using dynamic programming and profit-scaling. Our evaluation results indicate that the heuristics are within a factor of 1/2, and the FPTAS is very close to the optimal obtained from an ILP solver. We also propose a signaling mechanism to implement the content aware scheduler in existing LTE systems, and evaluate the impact of signaling delay on video distortion using both indoor and outdoor measurements collected from AT&T and T-Mobile networks."

Referential comments that provided objective information were found to be the most frequent messages. Results showed that the percentages of conative and emotive comments are greater when bugs are resolved without the requested fixes and when fixes are implemented in a long time.

It hinders air from passing through airpaths and causes that alveolar sacs lose their elastic quality. Findings of COPD may be manifested in a variety of computed tomography (CT) studies. Nevertheless, visual assessment of CT images is time-consuming and depends on trained observers. Hence, a reliable computer-aided diagnosis system would be useful to reduce time and inter-evaluator variability. In this paper, we propose a new emphysema classification framework based on complex Gabor filters and local binary patterns. This approach simultaneously encodes global characteristics and local information to describe emphysema morphology in CT images. Kernel Fisher analysis was used to reduce dimensionality and to find the most discriminant nonlinear boundaries among classes. Finally, classification was performed using the k-nearest neighbor classifier. The results have shown the effectiveness of our approach for quantifying lesions due to emphysema and that the combination of descriptors yields to a better classification performance."

This idea has strongly influenced scientific and technological models. However, in recent decades, chaos and complexity have shown that not every phenomenon is predictable, even if it is deterministic. If a problem space is predictable, in theory we can find a solution via optimization. Nevertheless, if a problem space is not predictable, or it changes too fast, very probably optimization will offer obsolete solutions. This occurs often when the immediate solution affects the problem itself. An alternative is found in adaptation. An adaptive system will be able to find by itself new solutions for unforeseen situations."

In our setting, there is a communication link between two trajectories if they are close enough, and drones can communicate provided they visit the link at the same time. Over time, one or more drones may fail and the ability to communicate and stay connected decreases. In this paper we study two properties related to communication: isolation and connectivity. First, we provide efficient algorithms, both centralized and decentralized, for determining the connected components induced by the set of surviving drones. Second, we study isolation and connectivity under a probabilistic failure model and show that, in the case of grids, the system is quite robust in the sense that it can tolerate a large probability of failure before drones become isolated and the system loses full connectivity."

It is therefore even more critical that such software be verified to be correct and to clearly understand what the safety implications of potential failures in sensors, actuators or faults of the software itself are. Using vectors of logic-labelled finite state machines, a clear semantics is obtained as well as executable models that provide the benefits that MDD promises. Since we can perform effective model-checking on these models, we show in this paper that we can use this to systematize and automate the failure mode and effect analysis of systems with embedded software. We illustrate this with two ubiquitous examples in the literature of model-checking for software in embedded systems."

Four distribution cases are evaluated: Wigner Ville, Choi Williams, Bessel and Born Jordan. A discrete distribution is formulated for each case and a criterion for determining the interaction between the spectral components of the signal is also given. Simplified discretised expressions for the implementation of distributions are formulated, these leading to a reduction of the computations realized when comparing to original definitions. Finally, a general parallel approach for the computation of the distributions is proposed, implemented and assessed by using a parallel DSP-based system. Copyright (C) 2001 IFAC."

The procedure involves first: segment the blood vessel, then locate the OD using the highest intensity values found near the vessels. Finally, OD segmentation is performed using a modification of the elliptical Hough transform. The results are evaluated using five different metrics already used in the literature on the subject, and applied to a public database of 1200 fundus images, obtaining 89% in the Dice coefficient and 82% in Jaccard coefficient, and taking a processing time of 4.1 seconds per image.

The considered class of descriptor systems assumes regularity, stability and is affected by unknown-but-bounded disturbances. As a first theoretical result, we establish a general framework for robust invariant sets for discrete-time descriptor systems in both causal and non-causal cases. Particular transformations are subsequently proposed for handling causal and non-causal descriptor systems and will be used to characterize the effects of disturbances. Based on these set-theoretic notions and a designed input signal for active set separations, we propose an active mode detection mechanism by exploiting the strong invariance properties."

The paper shows that if robots are asynchronous and may crash, then gathering is impossible for any graph G with at least two vertices, even if robots can have unique IDs, remember the past, know the same names for the vertices of G and use an arbitrary number of lights to communicate witheach other. Next, the paper studies two weaker variants of gathering: edge gathering and 1-gathering. For both problems we present possibility and impossibility results. The solvability of edge gathering is fully characterized: it is solvable for three or more robots on a given graph if and only if the graph is acyclic. Finally, general robot tasks in a graph are considered.

Since early treatments can help to control the symptoms, the quantification of emphysema has become an important topic. Here, we introduce a novel procedure to quantify emphysematous lesions using an ensemble of features based on log-Gabor filters, mean difference technique, and intensity values. This set captures both spatial and frequency variations and provides a suitable description of lung tissue. Leave-patient-out cross-validation was employed on the computed tomography emphysema database to validate our proposal. The sensitivity and specificity achieved were 91.22% and 95.48%, respectively. Such results have demonstrated that the proposed methodology could assist in quantification of emphysema."

Since speckle noise makes difficult the analysis of ultrasound images, the filtering process becomes a useful task in this application. The filtering techniques considered in this work assume that the speckle noise is a random variable with a Rayleigh distribution. We use two multiresolution methods: one based on wavelet decomposition and the other based on the Hermite transform. The filtering process is used as a way to strengthen the performance of the segmentation task. For the wavelet-based approach, a Bayesian estimator at subband level for pixel classification is employed. The Hermite method computes a mask to find those pixels that are corrupted by speckle. We picked out a method based on a deformable model or snake to evaluate the influence of the filtering techniques in the segmentation task. We selected the left ventricle in fetal echocardiographic images as structure of analysis. Quantitative evaluation is addressed to assess the performance of the filtering process and the segmentation task."

The method is based on interpreting the components of signal models as nodes in a sparsely connected network of overlaps (scalar products). Every point in the data sample expresses an overlap. Networks of this kind, in which nodes carry information by means of vectors, define a knowledge network, a recently introduced concept in the field of statistical physics. Previous results on the statistical properties of knowledge networks are generalized to noise reduction and its shown that is possible to extract important hidden quantities. In particular, an algorithm capable to give estimates of the unknown number of degrees of freedom in signal models is constructed and tested"

The Pascal matrix defined in [1], [2] has provided its utility in this field. In this paper we summarize the direct transformation from low-pass continuous-time transfer function H(s) to discrete-time H(z) of the bandpass and bandstop transfer functions. This algorithm uses the Pascal matrix and is constructed from the rows of a Pascal triangle. The advantage of this method is that the inverse transformation is obtained with the Pascal matrix without computing the determinant of the system, which simplifies the process to obtain the associated analog transfer function H(s) if the discrete transfer function H(z) is known. Numerical example for matrices P, P1, Q and Q1 illustrate the practical utilization of this technique."

Larger than necessary values of R cause communication interference and consumption of increased energy, while smaller values may disable data communication tasks such as routing and broadcasting. It was recognized that the minimum value of R that preserves the network connectivity is equal to the longest edge in the minimum spanning tree. However, all existing solutions for finding R rely on algorithms that require global network knowledge or inefficient straightforward distributed adaptations of centralized algorithms. This article proposes to use the longest LMST (local minimum spanning tree, recently proposed message free approximation of MST) edge to approximate R using a wave propagation quasi-localized algorithm. The differences between exact and so approximated values of R are estimated for two and three-dimensional random unit graphs. Despite small number of additional edges in LMST with respect to MST (under 5%), they can extend R by about 33% its range on networks with up to 500 nodes. We then prove that MST is a subset of LMST and describe a quasi-localized scheme for constructing MST from LMST. It needs less than 7 messages per node on average (for networks up to 500 nodes). The algorithm eliminates LMST edges which are not in MST by a loop breakage procedure, which iteratively follows dangling edges from leaves to LMST loops, and breaks loops by eliminating their longest edges, until the procedure finishes at a single node (as a byproduct, this single node can also be considered as an elected leader of the network). This so elected leader also learns longest MST edge in the process, and may broadcast it to other nodes. We also describe an algorithm for updating MST when a single node is added to the network."

We study the problem of finding a minimum witness set for an orthogonal polygon under three models of orthogonal visibility. It is known that not all simple polygons admit a finite witness set under the traditional line-segment visibility and, if a polygon admits a finite minimal witness set, then the witnesses must lie on the boundary of the polygon [5]. In this paper, we prove that every orthogonal polygon with n vertices admits a finite witness set with  witnesses under rectangular, staircase, and k-periscope visibility.

We call such a problem the most sustainable path (MSP) problem. We address the MSP problem in two network routing models: the wormhole and the circuit-switching routing models. We present fully-distributed polynomial-time algorithms for the streaming of constant-size data in the wormhole model, and for arbitrary-size data in the circuit-switching model. Our algorithms are simple and assume only local knowledge of the network topology at each node. The algorithms evolved from a variation of the classical Bellman-Ford shortest-path algorithm. One of the main contributions of this paper was to show how to extend the ideas in the Bellman-Ford algorithm to account for arbitrary time-dependent edge reliabilities"

In order to achieve finite-time convergence a nonlinear control algorithm based on a second-order sliding mode controller in combination with nonsingular terminal sliding mode is proposed. The proposed controller also exploits the properties of the hyperbolic tangent function. As a result, the control algorithm generates a continuous bounded signal. In addition, the controller structure is simple since it does not require the knowledge of the robot dynamic model.

Flooding is one of the most serious natural disasters humans confront in terms of loss of life and results in long-term effects, which often have severely adverse social consequences. However, flash floods are potentially more dangerous to life because there is often little or no forewarning of the impending disaster. The Emergency Water Information Network (EWIN) offers a solution that integrates an early warning system, notifications, and real-time monitoring of flash flood risks. The platform has been implemented in Colima, Mexico covering the Colima and Villa de Alvarez metropolitan area. This platform consists of eight fixed riverside hydrological monitoring stations, eight meteorological stations, nomadic mobile monitoring stations called “drifters” used in the flow, and a sniffer with data muling capability. The results show that this platform effectively compiles and forwards information to decision-makers, government officials, and the general public, potentially providing valuable minutes for people to evacuate dangerous areas."

The activity of frontal-lobe neurons during two-interval discrimination tasks is an example of these adaptable dynamics. Subjects first perceive a stimulus, then hold it in working memory, and finally make a decision by comparing it with a second stimulus. We present a simple mutual-inhibition network model that captures all three task phases within a single framework. The model integrates both working memory and decision making because its dynamical properties are easily controlled without changing its connectivity. Mutual inhibition between nonlinear units is a useful design motif for networks that must display multiple behaviors."

However, its operation is resource-intensive, especially in densely populated networks. Several approaches can be found in the literature to reduce the impact of flooding. Many of these approaches follow a repeal-based operation, chasing and stopping further propagation of flooding packets once the target is found. However, repeal-based protocols might end up transmitting even more packets than the original flooding. This work characterizes a maximum repeal-flooding boundary beyond which it is counterproductive to chase the original flooding. We present the Flood and Contain (F&C) algorithm, a method that can quickly establish the maximum repeal-flooding boundary for each node while making no assumptions on the underlying network. F&C’s packet overhead increases linearly with the hop count up to the maximum repeal-flooding boundary, in which case there is no attempt to chase the original flooding. In this latter case, F&C generates only as many packets as the original flooding. Simulations show that, on average, F&C reduces the total flooding overhead (compared to traditional flooding) up to 35 percent once considering all possible destinations, with only a slight increase in resource discovery latency, and it outperforms all other repeal-based protocols, particularly for longer routes."

Herein, we address the question of whether noise contributes to the generation of the stereotypical temporal pattern in gene expression during flower development. We modeled the regulatory network of organ identity genes in the Arabidopsis thaliana flower as a stochastic system. This network has previously been shown to converge to ten fixed-point attractors, each with gene expression arrays that characterize inflorescence cells and primordial cells of sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels. The network used is binary, and the logical rules that govern its dynamics are grounded in experimental evidence. We introduced different levels of uncertainty in the updating rules of the network. Interestingly, for a level of noise of around 0.5-10%, the system exhibited a sequence of transitions among attractors that mimics the sequence of gene activation configurations observed in real flowers. We also implemented the gene regulatory network as a continuous system using the Glass model of differential equations, that can be considered as a first approximation of kinetic-reaction equations, but which are not necessarily equivalent to the Boolean model. Interestingly, the Glass dynamics recover a temporal sequence of attractors, that is qualitatively similar, although not identical, to that obtained using the Boolean model. Thus, time ordering in the emergence of cell-fate patterns is not an artifact of synchronous updating in the Boolean model. Therefore, our model provides a novel explanation for the emergence and robustness of the ubiquitous temporal pattern of floral organ specification. It also constitutes a new approach to understanding morphogenesis, providing predictions on the population dynamics of cells with different genetic configurations during development. © 2008 Álvarez-Buylla et al."

Emphasis is placed on the solution of the problem rather than on its cause. The formulation is based on a system of equations for a network that has been constructed using the continuity equations for each node and the head-loss equations for each pipe. It contemplates two situations: One in which the elimination of a false negative pressure leads to the emptying of all the pipes that join a node, and the other in which the conditions are such that the elimination of the negative pressure leads to one or more pipes flowing partially full as an open channel. Two examples are presented to illustrate the applicability of the approximation, one for an imaginary simple network and the other for a water-delivery system in a large city. © ASCE."

Their capacities are extremely valuable as the size of these memories is limited due to several architectural constraints such as power and silicon area. This necessity is further exacerbated with the emergence of Software Defined Networks (SDN) where fine-grained flow definitions lead to explosion in the number of flow entries. In this paper, we propose FlowMaster, a speculative mechanism to update the flow table by predicting when an entry becomes stale and evict the same early to accommodate new entries. We collage the observations from predictors into a Markov based learning predictor that predicts whether a flow is valuable any more. Our experiments confirm that FlowMaster enables efficient usage of flow tables thereby reducing the discard rate from flow table by orders of magnitude and in some cases, eliminating discards completely."

Since the models of networks are usually sparse, a fluid model transformation is proposed that simplifies the residual generator design for fault detection. The transformation is achieved by the application of structural analysis together with properties of equivalence classes of the fluid model equations. This transformation allows to obtain a set of subsystems in which each of them is robust to a fault set by considering the structural model redundancy. As a case study, the monitoring of a pipeline with two branches is presented where the outflow rate deviation at each branch must be detected. Experimental data of a hydraulic pilot pipeline shows the simplicity of the algorithm."

Drug addiction forecasting is one of the basic components of the antidrug policy, giving informational and analytic support both at the regional and at the governmental level. However, views on the drug consumption problem vary in different regions, and as a consequence, several approaches to antidrug policy implementation exist. Thereby, notwithstanding the fact that the phenomenology of the population narcotization process is similar in the different regions, approaches to the modeling of drug addiction may also substantially differ for different kinds of antidrug policies. This paper presents a survey of the available antidrug policies and the corresponding approaches to the simulation of population narcotization. This article considers the approach to the construction of the regression model of anesthesia on the main components formed on the basis of indicators of social and economic development. The substantiation of the chosen method is given, which is associated with a significant correlation of indicators, which characterizes the presence of a small number of superfactors. This allows us to form a conclusion about the general level of development of the region as the main factor determining the drug addiction. A new model is proposed for one of the most widespread antidrug policies, namely, the drug use reduction policy. The model helps determine the significant factors of population narcotization and allows to estimate its damage. The model is tested successfully using St. Petersburg data."

To achieve this, a formal logical system is developed, whose purpose is to formally check the possible success or failure of the resulting implementation. This logic's focus is on modelling an agent's behaviour based on her goals, perceptions and actions. The article starts by giving a brief introduction to current research in reactive systems and cognitive task analysis. Simple definitions are offered of the basic concepts in these fields: agent, object, reactive behaviour, control, etc. As illustration, the paper offers the results of applying CTA to a simple model of postal delivery. Then, the syntax and semantics of the proposed logic are defined. Finally, the logic is applied to the verification of some of the behaviours resulting of the previous CTA analysis."

We argue that this shift from cognitive science to consciousness science presents a novel challenge to the fields of AI, robotics and related synthetic approaches. AI has traditionally formed the central foundation of cognitive science, and progress in artificial life has helped to pioneer a new understanding of cognition as embodied, situated and dynamical. However, in the current experiential turn toward the phenomenological aspects of mind, the role of these fields still remains uncertain. We propose that one way of dealing with the challenge of phenomenology is to make use of artificial life principles in the design of systems that include human observers inside the technologically mediated sensorimotor loops. Humancomputer interfaces enable us to artificially vary the embodiment of the participants, and can therefore be used as novel tools to systematically investigate the embodied mind ‘as-it-could-be’ from the first-person perspective. We illustrate this methodology of artificial embodiment by drawing on our research in sensory substitution, virtual reality, and interactive installation"

This approach can be considered as a geophysical realization of Hilbert's programme on axiomatization of statistical models in physics (the famous sixth Hilbert problem). In this conceptual paper, we continue development of this approach to decision-making under uncertainty which is generated by complexity variability, heterogeneity, anisotropy, as well as the restrictions to accessibility of subsurface structures. The belief state of a geological expert about the potential of exploring a hydrocarbon reservoir is continuously updated by outputs of measurements, and selection of mathematical models and scales of numerical simulation. These outputs can be treated as signals from the information environment E. The dynamics of the belief state can be modelled with the aid of the theory of open quantum systems: a quantum state (representing uncertainty in beliefs) is dynamically modified through coupling with E, stabilization to a steady state determines a decision strategy. In this paper, the process of decision-making about hydrocarbon reservoirs (e.g. 'explore or not?', 'open new well or not?', 'contaminated by water or not?', 'double or triple porosity medium?') is modelled by using the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad equation. In our model, this equation describes the evolution of experts' predictions about a geophysical structure. We proceed with the information approach to quantum theory and the subjective interpretation of quantum probabilities (due to quantum Bayesianism).

Two structurally identical agents engage in embodied interaction such that one of them can find a distant target in 2D space that only the other could perceive. This is a challenging task: during their interaction the agents must disambiguate translational and communicative movements, allocate distinct behavioral roles (sender versus receiver), and switch behaviors from communicative to target seeking behavior. We found an evolutionary convention with compositionality akin to the waggle dance, correlating duration and angle of interaction with distance and angle to target, respectively.

Eventually each process that crashes is suspected by every correct process, and there is a time after which some correct process is never suspected by only k processes. An eventual leader facility (usually denoted ω) is a device that eventually provides all the processes with the identity of one of them that is correct. Such a facility is used as a basic service in a lot of fault-tolerant distributed protocols (e.g., asynchronous consensus protocols). This paper proposes a protocol that builds an eventual leader service from any unreliable failure detector of the class ◇St+1 where t is the maximum number of processes that can crash during a run.

This paper presents a very simple and efficient algorithm that transforms any failure detector of the class oW into a failure detector of the class Omega. The simplicity of the transformation is due to its modular design-it is based on an underlying reliable broadcast facility. It is quiescent and requires each message to carry only one process identity, in addition to the control information appended to a message by the reliable broadcast mechanism (namely, a sequence number and the identity of its sender).

This paper clarifies the gap between ISO/IEC 29110 and MoProSoft level 2. As a result of a theoretical and practical review both standards have been mapped defining the coverage level between processes, considering the defined tasks, work products and roles. Several recommendations have been suggested to bridge the gap between these standards. Finally, the effort needed to adopt the Basic Profile of the new international standard starting from the Mexican standard has been estimated. The results have been extended"

However, early LR primordium (LRP) morphogenesis is not fully understood. In this study, we conducted both a clonal analysis and time-lapse experiments to decipher the pattern and sequence of pericycle founder cell (FC) participation in LR formation. Most commonly, LRP initiation starts with the specification of just one FC longitudinally. Clonal and anatomical analyses suggested that a single FC gradually recruits neighboring pericycle cells to become FCs. This conclusion was validated by long-term time-lapse live-imaging experiments. Once the first FC starts to divide, its immediate neighbors, both lengthwise and laterally, are recruited within the hour, after which they recruit their neighboring cells within a few hours. Therefore, LRP initiation is a gradual, multistep process. FC recruitment is auxin-dependent and is abolished by treatment with a polar auxin transport inhibitor. Furthermore, FC recruitment establishes a morphogenetic field where laterally peripheral cells have a lower auxin response, which is associated with a lower proliferation potential, compared to centrally located FCs. The lateral boundaries of the morphogenetic field are determined by phloem-adjacent pericycle cells, which are the last cells to be recruited as FCs. The proliferation potential of these cells is limited, but their recruitment is essential for root system formation, resulting in the formation of a new vascular connection between the nascent and parent root, which is crucial for establishing a continuous and efficient vascular system. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

We highlight some general principles of how social interaction can partially constitute an individual's behavior.

Failure detectors in the class ensure that eventually all the processes trust the same correct process. This paper presents a very simple and efficient algorithm that transforms any failure detector of the class into a failure detector of the class . The simplicity of the transformation is due to its modular design—it is based on an underlying reliable broadcast facility. It is quiescent and requires each message to carry only one process identity, in addition to the control information appended to a message by the reliable broadcast mechanism (namely, a sequence number and the identity of its sender).

In the basic shared memory system where the processes communicate through atomic read/write registers, at most one process may run solo. This paper introduces the family of d-solo models, where d-processes may concurrently run solo,  (the 1-solo model is the basic read/write model). The paper then studies distributed colorless computations in the d-solo models, where process ids are not used, either in task specifications or during computation. It presents a characterization of the colorless tasks that can be solved in each d-solo model. Colorless tasks include consensus, set agreement and many other previously studied tasks. It shows that colorless algorithms have limited computational power for solving tasks, only when . When , colorless algorithms can solve the same tasks as algorithms that may use ids. It is well-known that, while consensus is not wait-free solvable in a model where at most one process may run solo, ϵ-approximate agreement is solvable. In a d-solo model, the fundamental solvable task is -solo approximate agreement, a generalization of ϵ-approximate agreement. Indeed, -solo approximate agreement can be solved in the d-solo model, but not in the -solo model. Finally, the paper studies a link between the solvability of d-set agreement and -solo approximate agreement in asynchronous wait-free message-passing systems, which provides an insight on the “maximal partitioning” allowed to solve an approximate agreement task."

The routing uses only O(1) and O(log n) words routing table and packet labels respectively on a self-healing tree that also works using only O(1) words repairing the network in face of a strong adversary deleting nodes. This deterministic algorithm sets up its data structures in a preprocessing phase and then updates the required data structures in only O(1) parallel time per healing round during execution of the algorithm. However, CompactFTZ has no constraints in its preprocessing phase which could be done in distributed large memory or even centrally. In this paper, we correct that by developing the algorithms for preprocessing of CompactFTZ in a fully distributed manner using only O(log n) words memory in optimal time. In fact, the preprocessing for the self-healing tree (ForgivingTree) component takes only O(1) memory. We develop a local function which each node invokes to instantly compute and then relay its repair instructions (known as its Will) in only O(1) time. We formalise the low memory CONGEST model setting used in previous low memory algorithms (e.g.[24]); nodes working memory is restricted to be much smaller (in our case, O(log n)) than the numbers of their neighbours to whom they communicate through their I/O ports. We expand the model to allow for non-contiguous ports (e.g. empty ports or neighbours unmarked or lost in dynamic settings) and adversarial order of inputs from neighbours. Besides the Wills, we set up the tree structures and traversals for the routing scheme using only O(log n) memory and O(D) parallel time, where D is the diameter. Thus, we devise the first self-healing compact routing algorithm that can be fully set up and executed in low memory."

Despite a decade of extensive studies, network reconstruction remains an outstanding challenge. The fundamental limitations governing which properties of the interaction matrix (e.g. adjacency pattern, sign pattern or degree sequence) can be inferred from given temporal data of individual nodes remain unknown. Here, we rigorously derive the necessary conditions to reconstruct any property of the interaction matrix. Counterintuitively, we find that reconstructing any property of the interaction matrix is generically as difficult as reconstructing the interaction matrix itself, requiring equally informative temporal data. Revealing these fundamental limitations sheds light on the design of better network reconstruction algorithms that offer practical improvements over existing methods. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Therefore, its classification on-line becomes dependent on computation delays. In here, this problem is taken as a pattern recognition issues. The approach followed is based upon a Fuzzy ART2 network. It consists of two modules, firstly the recognition of new scenarios is performed by the network. Secondly, the classification of every group of patterns is performed by a decision making procedure. This work addresses the problem of fault classification online as a problem of pattern recognition rather than a fault detection approach. The use of pattern recognition presents the advantage of classification of recognized patterns as non fault scenario. The appearance of new patterns is taken as part of fault behaviour."

However, many traditional segmentation algorithm fail to segment objects that are characterized by textures whose patterns cannot be successfully described by simple statistics computed over a very restricted area. In this paper we present a fuzzy clustering algorithm that achieves the segmentation of images with color textures by employing a distance function based on the Skew Divergence, that is based on the well-known Kullback-Leibler Divergence. In order for such a distance to produce good results when applied to color images, we reduced the dimensionality of the image's histogram, thus eliminating the sparsity of the color histogram and speeding up the execution of the algorithm. We performed experiments on thin rock sections and compared our results to the segmentations obtained by the Fuzzy C-Means and by another fuzzy segmentation technique, showing the superiority of our approach."

A fuzzy model smoothly switches to estimate the system state; the antecedent input is the estimated sampling period and the consequent part is formed by linear models discretized with specific sampling periods. The fuzzy controller generates a control input using the estimated states to ensure system stability for a wide range of sampling periods. A two-degree-of-freedom helicopter is used to show the applicability and effectiveness of the controller with robustness to traffic.

Fuzzy segmentation is a semi-automatic region-growing segmentation algorithm that assigns to each element in an image a grade of membership in an object. In this paper, we propose an extension of the multi-object fuzzy segmentation algorithm to segment pre-acquired color video shots. The color features are selected from channels belonging to different color models using two different heuristics: one that uses the correlations between the color channels to maximize the amount of information used in the segmentation process, and one that chooses the color channels based on the separation of the clusters formed by the seed spels for all possible color spaces. Motion information is also incorporated into the segmentation process by making use of dense optical flow maps. We performed experiments on synthetic videos, with and without noise, as well as on some real videos. The experiments show promising results, with the segmentations of real videos produced using hybrid color spaces being more accurate than the ones produced using three other color models. We also show that our method compares favorably to a state-of-the art video segmentation algorithm."

However, few studies addressing global mechanisms for gene regulation of these two important organisms are available so far. A recent finding that the 2HH wild-type is closely related to P. oxalicum leads to a combined study of these two species. Firstly, we provide a global gene regulatory network for P. echinulatum 2HH and P. oxalicum 114-2, based on TF-TG orthology relationships, considering three related species with well-known regulatory interactions combined with TFBSs prediction. The network was then analyzed in terms of topology, identifying TFs as hubs, and modules. Based on this approach, we explore numerous identified modules, such as the expression of cellulolytic and xylanolytic systems, where XlnR plays a key role in positive regulation of the xylanolytic system. It also regulates positively the cellulolytic system by acting indirectly through the cellodextrin induction system. This remarkable finding suggests that the XlnR-dependent cellulolytic and xylanolytic regulatory systems are probably conserved in both P. echinulatum and P. oxalicum. Finally, we explore the functional congruency on the genes clustered in terms of communities, where the genes related to cellular nitrogen, compound metabolic process and macromolecule metabolic process were the most abundant.

The genetic expression in DNA microarrays present the opportunity to determine for example, which genes are involved with a particular disease, identify tumors, select the best treatment, etc. Several computational intelligence technique such as artificial neural networks can be used to identify different groups of genes associated with a particular disease. However, the enormous quantity of genes and the few samples available demand the use of more robust artificial neural networks. The purpose of this research is focused on showing how a generalize neuron (GN) can be applied in the DNA microarray classification task. In order to do that, the proposed methodology first, select the set of genes that best describe the disease applying the artificial bee colony algorithm. After that, the genes found during the first stage are used to train a GN. The GN is trained with the differential evolution algorithm. Finally, the accuracy of the proposed methodology is tested classifying two type of cancer using DNA microarrays: the acute lymphocytic leukemia and the acute myeloid leukemia. © 2016 IEEE."

This paper introduces and studies the family of generalized symmetry breaking (GSB) tasks, which includes election, renaming, and many other symmetry breaking tasks, and studies how nondeterminism properties of objects solving tasks affects the computability power of GSB tasks. The aim is to develop the understanding of symmetry breaking tasks and their relation with agreement tasks and to study nondeterminism properties of objects solving tasks and how these properties affect the computability power of symmetry breaking tasks. Among various results characterizing the family of GSB tasks, it is shown that perfect renaming, i.e., $(n,n)$-renaming, is universal for all GSB tasks. The paper also shows that there is a large family of GSB tasks, which includes perfect renaming, that is strictly more powerful than $(n,n-1)$-set agreement. Some of these tasks are equivalent to perfect renaming, while others lie strictly between perfect renaming and $(n,n+1)$-renaming. Results comparing renaming and set agreement are proved, and the results in this paper complement known results.

In some common applications, such as phylogenetic trees based on DNA sequences, relatedness can be inferred from the statistical analysis of unweighted attributes. The vast majority of mutations that survive across generations are evolutionarily neutral, which means that most genetic differences between species will have accumulated independently and randomly. In these cases, it is possible to calculate the tree from a precomputed matrix of distances. In other cases, such as with anatomical traits or languages, the assumption of random and independent differences does not hold, making it necessary to consider some traits to be more relevant than others for determining how related two entities are. In this paper, we present a constraint programming approach that can enforce consistency between bounds on the relative weight of each trait and tree topologies, so that the user can best determine which sets of traits to use and how the entities are likely to be related."

However, it is still unclear whether the road to hierarchical complexity is determined by the particularities of each phenomena, or if there are generic mechanisms of stratification common to many systems. Human sports and games, with their (varied but simple) rules of competition and measures of performance, serve as an ideal test-bed to look for universal features of hierarchy formation. With this goal in mind, we analyse here the behaviour of performance rankings over time of players and teams for several sports and games, and find statistical regularities in the dynamics of ranks. Specifically the rank diversity, a measure of the number of elements occupying a given rank over a length of time, has the same functional form in sports and games as in languages, another system where competition is determined by the use or disuse of grammatical structures. We use a Gaussian random walk model to reproduce the rank diversity of the studied sports and games. We also discuss the relation between rank diversity and the cumulative rank distribution.

A difference equation model representation was proposed for being the basis of the hierarchical tree encoding in GP. Based upon the NARMA difference equation model and formulating the identification as a multiobjective optimisation problem, Chua's circuit was studied. The formulation of the GP fitness function, defined as a multiobjective function, generated a set of nondominated chaotic models. This approach considered criteria related to the complexity, performance and also statistical validation of the models in the fitness evaluation. The final set of non-dominated model solutions were able to capture the dynamic characteristics of the system and reproduce the chaotic motion of the double scroll attractor. © 1999 IEEE."

The method is validated by comparing automatic vs. manual measurements in 17 individual bifurcations. We also compared automatic analyses of complete vascular trees from 4 pairs of red-free and fluorescein images. Preliminary results comparing 10 hypertensive and 10 normotensive subjects show changes in geometrical properties similar to those reported in previous studies. Several topological indices show differences in the arterial, but not venous, trees in hypertensive subjects. This suggests that a combination of geometrical and topological measurements of the whole vascular network may provide more sensitive indicators of morphological changes due to diseases."

It can cluster homologous gene families using the bidirectional best-hit, COGtriangles, or OrthoMCL clustering algorithms. Clustering stringency can be adjusted by scanning the domain composition of proteins using the HMMER3 package, by imposing desired pairwise alignment coverage cutoffs, or by selecting only syntenic genes. The resulting homologous gene families can be made even more robust by computing consensus clusters from those generated by any combination of the clustering algorithms and filtering criteria. Auxiliary scripts make the construction, interrogation, and graphical display of core genome and pangenome sets easy to perform. Exponential and binomial mixture models can be fitted to the data to estimate theoretical core genome and pangenome sizes, and high-quality graphics can be generated. Furthermore, pangenome trees can be easily computed and basic comparative genomics performed to identify lineage-specific genes or gene family expansions. The software is designed to take advantage of modern multiprocessor personal computers as well as computer clusters to parallelize time-consuming tasks. To demonstrate some of these capabilities, we survey a set of 50 Streptococcus genomes annotated in the Orthologous Matrix (OMA) browser as a benchmark case."

A nonlinear observer with exponential convergence is designed firstly to estimate the bias in gyro sensors. Then an exponentially convergent attitude tracking controller with gyro bias correction is devised. Next, to remove the topological constraints of unit quaternions for global stability, a switching variable with hysteresis is incorporated in the control loop, enhancing the robustness in the presence of measurement noise and energy efficiency by preventing the unwinding phenomenon. Numeric simulations are shown to illustrate the performance and compare with other similar controllers in terms of tracking error, estimation error and energy efficiency, as well as the robustness to noisy measurements and time-varying bias in gyro sensors. © 2021 ISA"

They have encouraged new ways to understand the mind. Mexico has not been an exception; rather, it has the potential to provide a fertile ground for the development of 4EC perspectives, as shown by the variety of contributions in this special issue. In this editorial introduction, we discuss recent concerns about a lack of coherence in the inter-relations between these perspectives, and we propose that it is more appropriate to view 4EC as an emerging pluralistic research tradition that shares crucial commitments. Furthermore, we show that this pluralistic tradition has been gaining ground in the specific research context of Mexico, because of the country's distinctive historical, scientific and philosophical development. We finish by describing the promising research potential of the current heterogeneous explanations as evidenced by the papers in this issue."

This is because they produce point clouds for each frame pair, which reduces multi-image 3D reconstruction to a relatively simple process of pose estimation followed by point cloud merging. There are several synchronized stereo cameras available on the market for this purpose, however a key problem is that they often come as fixed baseline units. This is a problem since the baseline that determines the range and resolution of the acquired 3D. This work deals with the fairly common scenario of trying to acquire a 3D reconstruction from a sequence of images, when the baseline of our camera is too small. Given such a sequence, in many cases it is possible to match each image with another in the sequence that has a more appropriate baseline. However is there still value in having calibrated stereo pairs then? Clearly not using the calibrated stereo pairs reduces the problem to a monocular 3D reconstruction problem, which is more complex with known issues such as scale ambiguity. This work attempts to solve the problem by proposing a guided stereo strategy that refines the coarse depth estimates from calibrated narrow stereo pairs with frames that are further away. Our experimental results are promising, since they show that this problem is solvable provided there are appropriate frames in the sequence to supplement the depth estimates from the original narrow stereo pairs."

It is useful to describe RBNs as self-organizing systems to study how changes in the nodes and connections affect the global network dynamics. This article reviews eight different methods for guiding the self-organization of RBNs. In particular, the article is focused on guiding RBNs toward the critical dynamical regime, which is near the phase transition between the ordered and dynamical phases. The properties and advantages of the critical regime for life, computation, adaptability, evolvability, and robustness are reviewed. The guidance methods of RBNs can be used for engineering systems with the features of the critical regime, as well as for studying how natural selection evolved living systems, which are also critical."

Superpixels provide visually significant regions and avoid a large number of redundant information to reduce dimensionality and complexity for subsequent image processing tasks. However, superpixel algorithms decrease performance in images with high-frequency contrast variations in regions of uniform texture. Moreover, most state-of-the-art methods use only basic pixel information -spatial and color-, getting superpixels with low regularity, boundary smoothness and adherence. The proposed algorithm adds texture information to the common superpixel representation. This information is obtained with the Hermite Transform, which extracts local texture features in terms of Gaussian derivatives. A local iterative clustering with adaptive feature weights generates superpixels preserving boundary adherence, smoothness, regularity, and compactness. A feature adjustment stage is applied to improve algorithm performance. We tested our algorithm on Berkeley Segmentation Dataset and evaluated it with standard superpixel metrics. We also demonstrate the usefulness and adaptability of our proposal in medical image application."

Moreover, most state-of-the-art methods use only basic pixel information -spatial and color-, getting superpixels with low regularity, boundary smoothness and adherence. The proposed algorithm adds texture information to the common superpixel representation. This information is obtained with the Hermite Transform, which extracts local texture features in terms of Gaussian derivatives. A local iterative clustering with adaptive feature weights generates superpixels preserving boundary adherence, smoothness, regularity, and compactness.

A Heterogeneous Processing Node (HPN) has been developed, which combines the communications ability of the transputer with a high performance signal processing of a DSP, in order to improve the time performance in parametric spectral estimation. The HPN includes libraries for downloading and executing precompiled ready to run DSP functions, using standard transputer programming tools. The heterogeneous approach has been used in a case study concerning parametric spectral estimation of Doppler ultrasound signals.

We used linear regression analysis on the spike data to both display the full heterogeneity of the data and classify cells into categories. We compared different categories of cells and found little difference in their ability to carry information about task variables or their correlation to behavior.

Identification of these facts in a text is not a trivial task. We present a heuristic algorithm for extraction of facts from sentences using a simple representation based on a relational data model. We focus our study on texts that contain a lot of facts by their nature: structured textbooks. The algorithm is based on data obtained by a syntactic analyzer. The obtained facts can be useful for information retrieval tasks, automatic summarization, etc. Our experiments are conducted for Spanish language. We obtained better results than the similar methods."

Heuristics are high cognitive processes of decision-making whose rapid and effortless implementation is useful to confront risk scenarios that compromise the viability of an individual. They can be defined in an enactive frame as self-sustained and self-generated habits of abductive behaviour selection in sensorimotor agents influenced by the individual history of sensorimotor contingencies and the environment. In this work, we analyse the emergence of patterns of behaviour and its necessary ecological conditions when performed decisions are related to energy intake and energy expenditure. Agent’s sensors and intentions are coupled to a variation of the iterant deformable sensorimotor medium (IDSM) (Egbert and Barandiaran, 2014). This model explains transparently the generation of sensorimotor habits in simulated robots through the influence of registers of previously executed behaviours reinforced by repetition. We create a decision-making frame based on intentions as probabilities of specific actions which constitute the motor component of sensorimotor states on IDSM. In this model is seen that specific behaviour correlations with the lifespan of agents depend on the availability of energetic sources on the environment. Inheritance of the medium is introduced in agents with a small improvement on the lifespan of agents."

We outline these issues and developments to guide researchers and students from all fields. With respect to philosophy, we provide brief summaries of debates with respect to (1) definitions (or theories) of life, what life is and how research should be conducted in the absence of an accepted theory of life, (2) the distinctions between synthetic, historical, and universal projects in origins-of-life studies, issues with strategies for inferring the origins of life, such as (3) the nature of the first living entities (the bottom up approach) and (4) how to infer the nature of the last universal common ancestor (the top down approach), and (5) the status of origins of life as a science. Each of these debates influences the others. Although there are clusters of researchers that agree on some answers to these issues, each of these debates is still open. With respect to history, we outline several independent paths that have led to some of the approaches now prevalent in origins-of-life studies. These include one path from early views of life through the scientific revolutions brought about by Linnaeus (von Linn.), Wohler, Miller, and others. In this approach, new theories, tools, and evidence guide new thoughts about the nature of life and its origin. We also describe another family of paths motivated by a circularity approach to life, which is guided by such thinkers as Maturana & Varela, Ganti, Rosen, and others. These views echo ideas developed by Kant and Aristotle, though they do so using modern science in ways that produce exciting avenues of investigation. By exploring the history of these ideas, we can see how many of the issues that currently interest us have been guided by the contexts in which the ideas were developed. The disciplinary backgrounds of each of these scholars has influenced the questions they sought to answer, the experiments they envisioned, and the kinds of data they collected. We conclude by encouraging scientists and scholars in the humanities and social sciences to explore ways in which they can interact to provide a deeper understanding of the conceptual assumptions, structure, and history of origins-of-life research. This may be useful to help frame future research agendas and bring awareness to the multifaceted issues facing this challenging scientific question."

Blood flow velocity and disturbance may be evaluated by measuring spectral mean frequency and bandwidth respectively. Aiming at minor stenosis diagnosis, parametric spectral estimators may be employed. These models present better spectral resolution than the FFT based ones, at the expense of higher computational burden. Seeking for an efficient real-time implementation of a blood now spectral estimation system, high performance techniques are being investigated. This paper compares the implementation of the modified covariance spectral estimator on two different DSP architectures: the TMS320C40 and the ADSP2016x (SHARC). Implementations are described and their performance assessed. Considerations about portability of algorithms, compiler optimisation levels and system dependence features are addressed"

They belong to a recently introduced class of controllers, named continuous HOSM since they are able to compensate exactly and in finite-Time perturbations/uncertainties using a continuous control signal. They are obtained by introducing a discontinuous integral action at the input of the plant. Here, continuously differentiable Lyapunov functions are used to rigorously prove the stability of the closed-loop system. We also investigate an approximation of this strategy, where a continuous integral term replaces the discontinuous one. The robustness properties of the closed-loop controller with continuous and discontinuous integral term are studied. © 1963-2012 IEEE."

The theory has been most successfully applied to vision and touch, while perceptual modalities that rely less on overt exploration of the environment have not received as much attention. In addition, most research has focused on philosophically grounding the theory and on psychologically elucidating sensorimotor laws, but the theory's ramifications for neuroscience still remain underexamined. Here we sketch the beginnings of a research program that could address these two outstanding challenges in terms of auditory perception. We review the neuroscience literature on passive listening, which is defined as listening without overt bodily movement, and conclude that sensorimotor theory provides a unique perspective on the consistent finding of motor system activation. In contrast to competing theories, this activation is predicted to be involved not only in the perception of speech- and action-related sounds, but in auditory perception in general. More specifically, we propose that the auditory processing associated with supplementary motor areas forms part of the neural basis of the exercise of sensorimotor know-how: these areas' recognized role in (1) facilitating spontaneous motor responses to sound and (2) supporting flexible engagement of sensorimotor processes to guide auditory experience and enable auditory imagery, can be understood in terms of two key characteristics of sensorimotor interaction, its (1) alerting capacity (or grabbiness) and (2) corporality (or bodiliness), respectively. We also highlight that there is more to the inside of the body than the brain: there is an opportunity to develop sensorimotor theory into new directions in terms of the still poorly understood active processes of the peripheral auditory system."

Here, we reconcile molecular and microscopic observations, reconnecting structure to function, by showing that human sperm uses asymmetric and anisotropic controls to swim. High-speed three-dimensional (3D) microscopy revealed two coactive transversal controls: An asymmetric traveling wave creates a one-sided stroke, and a pulsating standing wave rotates the sperm to move equally on all sides. Symmetry is thus achieved through asymmetry, creating the optical illusion of bilateral symmetry in 2D microscopy. This shows that the sperm flagellum is asymmetrically controlled and anisotropically regularized by fast-signal transduction. This enables the sperm to swim forward."

The facial recognition is complicated due to the variability of the facial appearance related the same person, and the small characteristic samples for each person in adverse conditions. To fix this, is considered the binary pattern models as an excellent choice to the local face representations, whose more important properties is their tolerance against the variations of luminance, scale and rotation. However, the binary pattern model is sensitive to small variations of the pixel intensities, generally caused by the noise, which introduce uncertainty to the texture and contrast representation of the facial image. Using fuzzy logic in the binary patterns calculation, leads to a texture representation model that takes into account the uncertainty of the contained information in each image, providing a better representation of texture and contrast measure. In combination with traditional algorithms in the pre-processing stage, as photometric and histogram normalization, the feature extraction stage is achieved using linear discriminants and Gabor wavelets to provide finally a stage of the support vector machines classification."

Results showed that incorrect visual feedback increased the error in both groups. In lows, the error was similar after active and passive movements; in highs, it was lower for active than passive movements toward the medial position, but lower for passive than for active movements for the lateral one. The highs' error was significantly lower than the lows' one only for the active movements directed toward the medial hand position.

We observed that Helicobacter pylori and Neisseria spp. presented the highest number of MTases while ten different species did not present a predicted DNA MTase. We also detected a significant increase of adenine MTases over cytosine MTases (2.19 vs. 1.06, respectively, p < 0.001). Adenine MTases were the only MTases associated with restriction modification systems and DNA MTases associated with type I restriction modification systems were more numerous than those associated with type III restriction modification systems (0.84 vs. 0.17, p < 0.001); additionally, there was no correlation with the genome size and the total number of DNA MTases, indicating that the number of DNA MTases is related to the particular evolution and lifestyle of specific species, regulating the expression of virulence genes in some pathogenic bacteria. © 2015, Association of Microbiologists of India."

In addition, we evaluated the consecutive enzymatic reaction pairs obtained from metabolic pathway reactions and transformed into sequences of enzymatic reactions, with catalytic activities encoded in the Enzyme Commission numbers, which are linked by a substrate. Both analyses are complementary: The first considers individual reactions associated with each organism and metabolic map, and the second evaluates the functional associations between pairs of consecutive reactions. From these comparisons, we found a set of five enzymatic reactions that were widely distributed in all the organisms and considered here as universal to Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya; whereas 132 pairs out of 3151 reactions were identified as significant, only 5 of them were found to be widely distributed in all the taxonomic divisions. However, these universal reactions are not widely distributed along the metabolic maps, suggesting their dispensability to all metabolic processes. Finally, we found that universal reactions are also associated with ancestral domains, such as those related to phosphorus-containing groups with a phosphate group as acceptor or those related to the ribulose-phosphate binding barrel, triosephosphate isomerase, and D-ribose-5-phosphate isomerase (RpiA) lid domain, among others.

The DHT analyzes a signal through a set of binomial filters which approximate the Gaussian derivatives with the advantage that they are computed efficiently. In order to obtain the DHT referred to a rotated coordinate system the set of coefficients of a given order are mapped through a unitary transformation that is locally specified. Such a transformation is based on the generalized binomial functions so that the rotation algorithm is efficient too. This representation allows a perceptual classification, which is achieved by thesholding the approximation errors that are obtained under the hypotheses that the underlying pattern is a constant (0-D), an oriented structure (1-D) or a non-oriented estructure (2-D). The threshold is based on light adaptation and contrast masking properties of the human vision. Then, a compression is obtained by elimination of coefficients that are visually irrelevant."

The transfer of contaminants to water resources is of particular importance in the Valle de Bravo watershed as it provides 10% of the drinking water for the 20 million inhabitants of Mexico City. This watershed is composed mainly of Andosols with unique mineralogical and physical characteristics. Soil porosity is usually examined on thin sections, using various image analysis techniques. We propose a novel methodology combining image analysis and a displacement experiment to study relationships between soil structure and water tracer transport parameters. H218O displacement experiments were conducted through intact soil columns sampled at three depths from a representative cultivated Andosol profile. The soil structure and pore characteristics were obtained by image analysis on thin sections obtained from each column at the end of the displacement experiment. The total 2D porosity (for pores larger than 50 μm) varied from 80% of the total section area in the topsoil to around 60% in the subsoil. Tubular pores were the most abundant in the soil profile, but ploughing of the topsoil had destroyed sections of these pores and replaced them with packing pores. Water transport in the intact subsoil columns was always in physical non-equilibrium, showing the existence of preferential flow pathways. In the topsoil, one column out of three showed no preferential flow, demonstrating that soil ploughing also homogenised pore connections. Pore connectivity was larger in the ploughed topsoil than in their deeper soil horizon counterparts. Our methodology offers a 2D quantitative characterisation of the macroporous network at 50 μm resolution and the determination of water transport parameters on the same intact soil samples. 3D characterisation of soil porosity using X-ray computed tomography (CT) gives a better picture of pore connection but usually has lower spatial resolution and a larger cost."

To achieve ail acceptable level of watermark invisibility, masking properties of the Human Vision system (HVS) are exploited in the extraction of relevant local image features (texture, smooth regions, edges) for watermark embedding purpose. Many other works suggest the use of wavelets or contourlets. In our case, image features are extracted efficiently from the Hermite transform image representation which agrees with the Gaussian derivative model of the human visual perception. The resulting weighing mask is used to adapt the watermark strength to image regions during the embedding process. In order to ensure watermark resistance to global affine geometric attacks (rotation, scaling, translation and shearing) the design of the watermarking scheme is modified, mainly, by incorporating a normalization procedure. Image normalization, a means to achieve invariance to geometric transformations, is well known in computer vision and pattern recognition areas. In this new design, both watermark embedding and detection are carried out in the Hermite transform domain of moment-based normalized images. A sequence of tests is conducted on various images. Many removal attacks (.JPEG compression, additive noise and filtering) as well as geometric attacks are applied from the Checkmark benchmark. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the whole scheme in achieving Its goals in terms of watermark invisibility and robustness."

Traditionally, due to the inherent characteristics of the rapid sperm movement, and to the technological limitations of microscopes (optical or confocal) to follow in three dimensions (3D) their movement, the analysis of their dynamics has been studied in two dimensions, when the head is confined to a surface. Flagella propel sperm and while their head can be confined to a surface, flagellar movement is not restricted to 2D, always displaying 3D components. In this work, we present a highly novel and useful tool to analyze sperm flagella dynamics in 3D. The basis of the method is a 100 Hz oscillating objective mounted on a bright field optical microscope covering a 16 microns depth space at a rate of ~ 5000 images per second. The best flagellum focused subregions were associated to their respective Z real 3D position. Unprecedented graphical results making evident the 3D movement of the flagella are shown in this work and supplemental material illustrating a 3D animation using the obtained experimental results is also included."

Three immobilization points are always sufficient for a polygon with vertices in general positions, but four points are necessary for some polygons with parallel edges. An O(n log n) algorithm that finds a set of 3 points that immobilize a given polygon with vertices in general positions is suggested. The algorithm becomes linear for convex polygons. Some results are generalized for d-dimensional polytopes, where 2d points are always sufficient and sometimes necessary to immobilize. When the polytope has vertices in general position d+1 points are sufficient to immobilize."

Sustainably managing volcanic soils requires understanding how land use affects their hydrodynamic properties. Gas adsorption and mercury intrusion porosimetry, water retention curves, tension infiltrometry and X-ray tomography were used to describe pore structure characteristics. Two volcanic soils (one Andosol and one derived from indurated tuff - Tepetates), three land uses (maize monoculture, maize-wheat rotation and fallow) and two horizons (Ap and A2 for maize monoculture and maize-wheat rotation) were studied. Tillage affected topsoil by increasing the sand fraction by 38% and decreasing total porosity and macroporosity by 23% and 40% respectively. Macropore size was reduced and the number of isolated macropores was higher in the tilled layer under maize, compared with untilled subsoil. The plot under maize-wheat rotation had lower allophane content, and saturated hydraulic conductivity was reduced by nearly an order of magnitude and water retention by half, compared with maize and fallow plots. Compared with Andosols, Tepetates showed differences in mineralogical composition with lower contents of amorphous compounds and in its porous network characteristics with twice the total and percolating macroporosity compared with the maize plot. Its high content of organic carbon (3.5%) seemed beneficial for its hydrodynamic properties. Sustainable agricultural management of these volcanic soils requires reducing mechanised tillage, avoiding periods when soil is bare, not applying maize-wheat rotation and applying maize-fallow rotation allowing natural vegetation growth."

In opaque networks, these regenerators are installed in all the nodes. However as the size of the network increases, several practical issues related to regenerators such as installation costs, power consumption, physical space requirements, upgradability, operation and maintenance costs etc. have to be considered. In view of these practical constraints, the trend has been to move towards the low cost translucent networks, in which the 3R regenerators are sparsely yet strategically placed in the network. We propose a new approach to solve the Impairment-Aware Routing and Wavelength Assignment (IA-RWA) problem under dynamic network traffic conditions, assuming a given sparse placement of the regeneration capable nodes. Since 3R regenerators use Optical-to-Electrical-to-Optical (OEO) conversion to restore the optical signal quality, which is an expensive operation, the objective of our IA-RWA approach is to find a solution that involves the fewest possible number of regenerators. Our approach is based on the A* (Best First Search) algorithm and guarantees an optimal solution (if it exists)."

These phantoms are dummy representations of the human tissue of the breast gland. We focus our attention on the representation of the optical and the mechanical properties of the actual biological healthy tissue and of that representing a hidden cancer tumor (lesion). The quality of the samples is tested by ultrasonic imaging and laser induced photothermal (PT) detection technique. From the former test, the mechanical contrast that one can achieve is apparent. Instead, the laser detection technique makes it possible to determine that the optical contrast is achievable. For the laser induced PT method we register the so-called photothermal amplitudes, rather known as photoacoustic (PA) signals. These are the ultimate expression of laser-induced bursts of photothermal processes, whose engine is the fraction of the optically absorbed energy that decays through nonradiative channels. In our case we look for the conditions at which the PT phenomena are produced by a hidden dummy-tumor alone; meaning that the output signals are nearly free from substantial contributions from the bulk of the phantom. This is so as to mimic the actual mechanical and optical absorption performance of breast tissue with an inner cancer tumor. From the ultrasound images one can see how apparent the resemblance with the actual human tissue is."

Processes in the system can access the object invoking (any number of times) two operations, denoted write() and snapshot(). A process invokes write() to update the value of its register in the array. When it invokes snapshot(), the process obtains the values of all registers, as if it read them simultaneously. It is known that a snapshot object can be implemented on top of SWMR registers, tolerating any number of process failures. Snapshot objects provide a level of abstraction higher than individual SWMR registers, and they simplify the design of applications. Building a snapshot object on an asynchronous crash-prone message-passing system has similar benefits. The object can be implemented by using the known simulations of a SWMR shared memory on top of an asynchronous message-passing system (if less than half the processes can crash), and then build a snapshot object on top of the simulated SWMR memory. This paper presents an algorithm that implements a snapshot object directly on top of the message-passing system, without building an intermediate layer of a SWMR shared memory. To the authors knowledge, the proposed algorithm is the first providing such a direct construction. The algorithm is more efficient than the indirect solution, yet relatively simple."

But, it does not produce heterogeneous local popularities of nodes in a community as observed in real mobility traces. Further, it does not consider Levy walk nature of human mobility which has significant impact on performance of protocols. We propose Improved Heterogeneous Human Walk (IHHW) model that correctly produces heterogeneous local popularities and also incorporates Levy walk nature of human mobility within overlapping community structure. As popular nodes are very useful for data dissemination, we also propose theoretical methods to identify popular nodes within community (hubs) and in entire network (gateways) from overlapping community structure itself. These nodes can act as hubs/gateways till overlapping community structure does not change. Our methods eliminate the need to identify and change these nodes dynamically when network is operational."

We have used an improved spread spectrum technique for additive watermark embedding. As usual, the watermark embedded is retrieved by computing the correlation between the watermarked coefficients and the pseudorandom sequences. The detection threshold is optimized via Neyman-Pearson criterion, hence the watermark detection can be performed without knowing the value of the watermark strength, which can thus be accurately adapted to each image. In order to prove the validity of our approach, we present experimental results, our algorithm is robust to common signal processing operations, which could be both intentional or unintentional. Proposed algorithm also shows improvement in visual and invisibility of the hidden data."

We show that the ITK implementation achieves high quality segmentations with markedly improved computational efficiency. The ITK version has greater segmentation accuracy, from 0.94 to 0.96, than the Matlab version due to a decrease in FPR values and it is between 8 and 12 times faster than the original version. Furthermore, the ITK implementation is able to segment high-resolution images in an acceptable timescale."

The Inception phase of projects is in charge to provide these outcomes and is suitable to really involve stakeholders as team members because of the non-technical nature of the activities. However, since the stakeholders' involvement is a time- and money-consuming activity, it is important to maximize its efficiency. With that in mind, ludic aspect inherent to games can be used as a strategy to optimize the Inception phase. This paper presents ActiveAction, a game-based workshop used as an alternative for the software project's Inception phase in order to increase its effectiveness and improve the stakeholders' involvement in the project. ActiveAction combines classical and game-based techniques which permit a deep involvement of stakeholders and a collaborative identification of objectives, constraints and risks during an intensive workshop oriented to project conceptualization. ActiveAction workshop resulted in a successful game-based strategy that has improved the Inception phase of 19 projects with different customers. After-workshop surveys, projects outcomes and customer satisfaction indicate validity of the method. ActiveAction is a valuable game-based alternative to carry out the Inception phase in a software project. It makes possible to get an important amount of information, directly from key stakeholders in a short period of time increasing the success rate of projects."

However, these equations only apply when the time constant of the circuit is much larger than the period of the input signal and those equations for the case in which this condition is not met, are not presented. Herein, the most common equations in the literature are resumed. Next, the circuit is analyzed using three models of the diode and, for each one, a set of equations has been obtained to calculate the voltages, currents and times of the circuit. To apply these equations, the discharging time of the capacitor must be calculated through the solution of a transcendental equation. Nowadays, the computational tools to make this task easily are common and this should not be a challenge anymore. Also, performing these analyses could improve the understanding of the students and their capability to analyze circuits with diodes. Two examples are proposed to compare the equations proposed with the numerical solutions and the equations found in literature. Errors between the results obtained with the equations and the numerical simulations are less than 1% for the ripple, average and RMS voltages and maximum and repetitive average currents when the constant-drop model is used. The RMS current had an error of 6% because the conduction time of the diode is larger than that expected because of the nonlinear behavior of the diode. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

The microscopy studies show that the produced carbon nanotubes have disorder morphologies with diameters between 60 and 100 nm and lengths of a few hundred microns. Ni particles of 40 nm are well dispersed along the carbon nanotubes. XRD patterns show the crystalline planes corresponding to graphite and metallic Ni. The TGA-DTA results indicate a Ni loading of 20wt%. Raman spectroscopy reveals that the grown carbon nanotubes are graphitized, showing both the D and G bands at 1330 cm(-1) and 1590 cm(-1), respectively.

This book collects all the main aspects of these operators in a single volume for the first time. The stress is put on the study of their structure and the monograph starts presenting the different ways in which indistinguishability operators can be generated and represented. Special attention is paid to the Representation Theorem and the Sup-T product. Extensionality of fuzzy subsets is studied in detail and is related to their observability and to the granularity. The metric behaviour of indistinguishability operators and their connection with cluster analysis and hierarchical trees is established. Different ways to aggregate such operators are given as well as a number of methods to obtain transitive approximations of a fuzzy relation. Applications to approximate reasoning and to the study of fuzzy subgroups are also provided. The book ends with a chapter on finite-valued indistinguishability operators.

However, modellers also reason with influence diagrams to represent the positive and negative influences between molecular species and may find an influence network useful in the process of building a reaction network. In this paper, we introduce a formalism of influence networks with forces, and equip it with a hierarchy of Boolean, Petri net, stochastic and differential semantics, similarly to reaction networks with rates. We show that the expressive power of influence networks is the same as that of reaction networks under the differential semantics, but weaker under the discrete semantics. Furthermore, the hierarchy of semantics leads us to consider a (positive) Boolean semantics that cannot test the absence of a species, that we compare with the (negative) Boolean semantics with test for absence of a species in gene regulatory networks à la Thomas. We study the monotonicity properties of the positive semantics and derive from them an algorithm to compute attractors in both the positive and negative Boolean semantics. We illustrate our results on models of the literature about the p53/Mdm2 DNA damage repair system, the circadian clock, and the influence of MAPK signaling on cell-fate decision in urinary bladder cancer."

A total of 228 pluviometrie records available in Mexico were analyzed, and the one to 24 hour (R) relationship was determined. The records were taken at the pluviometrie station of Tacubaya, Mexico, covering the period 1970 to 1996. When the recording period is less than 20 years, the R ratio tends to vary significantly, and events used in the design of hydraulic projects can be underestimated or overestimated. For records of longer than 20 years, the R ratio becomes stable. It is concluded that it is possible to determine the error incurred in the estimation of costs over a certain period of return for the design of a hydraulic project."

I argue that these alternatives are also inherently limited and that these limits can only be overcome by considering materialism, info-computationalism, and cognition at the same time."

This measure is highly specific to grey-level inter-chromosome coarseness features in microscopic images of metaphase spreads and allows the texture quantification of cytological objects, analysing the intensity profile between chromosome-extrema samples. Chromosome fragments produce patterns of pixels at low resolution, and the local neighbourhood of their individual extrema presents a characteristic coarseness along intensity profiles, on randomly oriented test lines. Results of the use of this new measure on microscope images of fields of metaphases and artifacts are compared with some representative texture measures and the performance of reported metaphase finders. This new measure outperforms the latter, when applied in metaphase detection and elimination of artifacts. This coarseness feature provides a specific metaphase signature that can be used in conjunction with other morphological and textural parameters for automated metaphase discrimination."

However, introspection has long been assumed to be too limited and fallible. This skepticism is primarily based on a series of classic psychological experiments, which suggested that more is seen than can be retrospectively reported (Sperling, 1960), and that we can be easily fooled into retrospectively describing intentional choices that we have never made (Johansson, Hall, Silkstrom, & Olsson, 2005; Nisbett & Wilson, 1977). However, the work by Petitmengin, Remillieux, Cahour, and Carter-Thomas (2013) could resolve this dilemma. They showed that subjects can be interactively guided to become better aware of their past experience, thereby overturning the choice blindness results of Johansson et al. (2005). Although some more fine-tuning of the experimental protocol is needed, interactively guided introspection may well become the most reliable and exhaustive measure of consciousness.

Yet much of the former has already started to move in a direction favored by the latter: toward systematic studies of how human activity is shaped by social, cultural, and technological influences. Interactivity could therefore help enaction to provide a better account of such highly mediated and augmented forms of sense-making."

The asymmetry of flagellar beat in spermatozoa is finely regulated by intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca 2+ ] i). Recently, we demonstrated that the application of high concentrations (10-20 μM) of the Ca 2+ ionophore A23187 promotes sperm immobilization after 10 min, and its removal thereafter allows motility recovery, hyperactivation, and fertilization. In addition, the same ionophore treatment overcomes infertility observed in sperm from Catsper1 - ', Slo3 ', and Adcy10 ', but not PMCA4 ', which strongly suggest that regulation of [Ca 2+ ] i is mandatory for sperm motility and hyperactivation. In this study, we found that prior to inducing sperm immobilization, high A23187 concentrations (10 μM) increase flagellar beat. While 5-10 μM A23187 substantially elevates [Ca 2+ ] i and rapidly immobilizes sperm in a few minutes, smaller concentrations (0.5 and 1 μM) provoke smaller [Ca 2+ ] i increases and sperm hyperactivation, confirming that [Ca 2+ ] i increases act as a motility switch. Until now, the [Ca 2+ ] i thresholds that switch motility on and off were not fully understood. To study the relationship between [Ca 2+ ] i and flagellar beating, we developed an automatic tool that allows the simultaneous measurement of these two parameters. Individual spermatozoa were treated with A23187, which is then washed to evaluate [Ca 2+ ] i and flagellar beat recovery using the implemented method. We observe that [Ca 2+ ] i must decrease below a threshold concentration range to facilitate subsequent flagellar beat recovery and sperm motility. © The Author(s) 2018.

The communication methodology aims to improve the transmission of information and minimise imperfections through the scheduling and synchronisation of the nodes present in the network as a function of the system performance. The co-design methodology considers increasing the advantages of the various methodologies with the purpose of increasing system performance and minimising the effects of network imperfections. It is also presented the time delay modelling in nondeterministic networks, the main imperfection of the network. Finally, the maximum allowed transfer interval term is described which is the maximum bound for time imperfections of the network."

In this paper, we describe the ability to invariantly recognize assembly parts at different scale, rotation and orientation within the work space. The paper shows a methodology for on-line recognition and classification of pieces in robotic assembly tasks and its application into an intelligent manufacturing cell. The performance of industrial robots working in unstructured environments can be improved using visual perception and learning techniques. In this sense, the described technique for object recognition is accomplished using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) architecture which receives a descriptive vector called CFD&POSE as the input. This vector represents an innovative methodology for classification and identification of pieces in robotic tasks. The vector compresses 3D object data from assembly parts and it is invariant to scale, rotation and orientation, and it also supports a wide range of illumination levels. The approach in combination with the fast learning capability of ART networks indicates the suitability for industrial robot applications as it is demonstrated through experimental results. © 2006 IEEE."

The method has been tested with data acquired with a single-input accelerometer. Experimental results show that with the correct number of neurons and the proper training the NN can be used as an inverse filter

To circumvent this impossibility, distributed oracles (also called unreliable failure detectors) have boon introduced. A failure detector provides information on failures, and a failure detector class is defined by a set of abstract properties that encapsulate (and hide) synchrony assumptions. Sonic failure detector classes have been shown to be the weakest to solve some agreement problems (e.g., Ω is the weakest class of failure detectors that allow solving the consensus problem in asynchronous systems whore a majority of processes do not crash). This paper considers several failure detector classes and focuses on their additivity or their irreducibility. It mainly investigates two families of failure detector classes (denoted ◇Sx and ◇φy, 0 ≤ x,y ≤ n), shows that they can be ""added"" to provide a failure detector of the class Ω (a generalization of Ω). It also characterizes the power of such an ""addition"", namely, ◇Sx + ◇φy → Ωz ⇔ x + y + z &gt; t; + 1, where t is the maximum number of processes that can crash in a run. As an examples, the paper shows that, while ◇St allows solving 2-set agreement (and not consensus) and ◇φ1 allows solving t-set agreement (but not (t -1 )-set agreement), their ""addition"" allows solving consensus. More generally, the paper studies the failure detector classes ◇S x, ◇φy and Ω, and shows which reductions among these classes are possible and which are not. The paper presents also an Ωkbased k-set agreement protocol. In that sense, it can be seen as a step toward the characterization of the weakest failure detector that allows solving the k-set agreement problem. Copyright 2006 ACM."

We argue that the enactive theory of agency developed by Barandiaran, Di Paolo and Rohde (2009) provides a principled way of grounding agency in biological organisms. However the importance of biological embodiment for the enactive approach might lead one to be skeptical as to whether artificial systems or collectives of individuals could instantiate genuine agency. To explore this issue we contrast the concept of collective agency with multi-agent systems and multi-system agents, and argue that genuinely collective agents instantiate agency at both the collective level and at the level of the component parts. Developing the enactive model, we propose understanding agency – both at the level of the individual and of the collective – as spectra that are constituted by dimensions that vary across time. Finally, we consider whether collectives that are not merely metaphorically ‘agents’ but rather are genuinely agentive also instantiate subjectivity at the collective level. We propose that investigations using the perceptual crossing paradigm suggest that a shared lived perspective can indeed emerge but this should not be conflated with a collective first-person perspective, for which material integration in a living body may be required."

Both disorders have a strong ancillary role in theoretical research on social cognition. Recently the debate has started to be inflected by embodied and phenomenological approaches, which claim that the standard portrayal of all social understanding as so-called 'mindreading', i.e. the attribution of mental states to others in the service of explaining and predicting their behavior, is misguided. Instead it is emphasized that we normally perceive others directly as conscious and goal-directed persons, without requiring any theorizing and/or simulation. This paper evaluates some of the implications of abnormal experiences reported by people with schizophrenia and ASD for the current debate in cognitive science. For these people the practice of explicit mindreading seems to be a compensatory strategy that ultimately fails to compensate for - and may even exacerbate - their impairment of intuitive and interactive social understanding. Phenomenological psychopathology thereby supports the emerging view that 'mindreading' is not the principal form of normal social understanding. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Here we will not address the fundamental question of whether computational models are appropriate for describing some or all of the wide range of processes that they have been applied to, but will focus instead on whether ‘renovated’ versions of the new computationalism shed any new light on or resolve previous tensions between proponents and skeptics. We find this, however, not to be the case, because the new computationalism falls short by using limited versions of “traditional computation”, or proposing computational models that easily fall within the scope of Turing’s original model, or else proffering versions of hypercomputation with its many pitfalls."

However, such increase in temperature could be controlled by lowering dialysate's temperature using two main modalities techniques (isothermic and thermoneural) with different patient's thermal balance consequences, not yet well studied. In this work, energy expenditure (EE) was measured by indirect calorimetry in a group of 12 patients waiting kidney transplant. In each patient, EE was assessed (as a power generation) during isothermic and thermoneutral modalities as a manner of cross and prospective study (a) at before therapy, (b) during therapy and (c) at the end of the HDF therapy. Wheraeas, power extraction was measured by a BTM (Blood Temperature Monitor from Fresenius Inc) in order to determine power balance in a thermodynamic model of the extracorporeal circuit. The results showed significant differences in the power balance when EE at during therapy was subtracted from the EE at before therapy. Then, EE increments were 32 Kcal/4-hours during isothermic and 3.6 Kcal/4-hours during thermoneutral HDF sessions (p < 0.05). While, BTM totals power extraction was 91 and 16.1 Kcal/4-hours (p<0.05), respectively. Additionally, it was estimated a 12 % of EE/day increment during HDF-isothermic at during therapy stage compared with none significative EE increment during thermoneutral modality. The statistical evidence confirmed the expected hypothesis that both modalities affect in different manner the patient's EE. Also, we conclude there is no satisfactory data interpretation when the thermodynamic model was applied expecting null balance between EE increment and BTM power extraction. Therefore, these findings force to think there is need of different BTM design and measurement setting with ability to follow dynamic patient's EE changes with the purpose to achieve a better power balance. © 2008 IEEE."

To solve the problem in the framework of model-based procedures, a nonlinear input-output model with five state is proposed which is equivalent to the fluid model with multiple faults in steady-state. This input-output model has the property to retain the data of the past leaks allowing only the identification on-line of the new event during a time window for any arbitrary number of leaks. Specifically, two sets of parameters characterize each event in the model: one set associated with the past events in the equivalent leaks model and the second one which contains the latest event parameters. Thus, an iterative Fault Detection and Isolation scheme is suggested which identifies each time a new leak is present its outflow an position, together with the equivalent model by using adaptive Extended Kalman Filters. The simulation for a sequential set of three leaks shows successful results."

While comparing this unusual method with a traditional bag ofwords representation an improvement in the performance of the algorithms was observed. The authors think this method of representation might have implications for future studies of the computational interpretation of texts."

We combine both to study the computability of k-set agreement. Among all the possible round-based models, we consider oblivious ones, where the constraints are given only round per round by a set of allowed graphs. And among oblivious models, we focus on closed-above ones, that is models where the set of possible graphs contains all graphs with more edges than some starting graphs. These capture intuitively the underlying structure required by some communication model, like containing a ring. We then derive lower bounds and upper bounds in one round for k-set agreement, such that these bounds are proved using combinatorial topology but stated only in terms of graph properties. These bounds extend to multiple rounds when limiting our algorithms to be oblivious -- recalling only pairs of processes and initial value, not who send what and when."

It presents a hydrological imbalance problem caused by diminishing intakes from the Lerma River, pollution from said volumes, native vegetation and solid waste. This article presents a study that allows us to determine with high precision the extent of the affectation in both extension and volume reduction of the Lake Chapala in the period going from 1990 to 2007. Through satellite images this above-mentioned period was monitored. Image segmentation was achieved through a Markov Random Field model, extending the application towards edge detection. This allows adequately defining the lake's limits as well as determining new zones within the lake, both changes pertaining the Lake Chapala. Detected changes are related to a hydrological balance study based on measuring variables such as storage volumes, evapotranspiration and water balance. Results show that the changes in the Lake Chapala establish frail conditions which pose a future risk situation. Rehabilitation of the lake requires a hydrologic balance in its banks and aquifers. © 2008 SPIE."

The analyses were carried out on both human-made and machine-made summaries, in order to determine whether current ATS systems capture the same kind of information as humans do. Our results show that there are some marked differences between machine and human-made summaries, which at times may seem counterintuitive. For instance, named entities were usually present in machine-made summaries, but not in human-made ones. Similarly, words perceived to hold a “neutral” sentiment were systematically favored by machines, but not always by humans."

This is due to the fact that the mere fact of transmitting may allow a network to pinpoint a mobile node. We consider that a first step to protect a mobile node in this situation is to provide it with the means to quantify how accurately a network establishes its position. To achieve this end, we introduce the location-exposure algorithm (LEA), which runs on the mobile terminal only and whose operation consists of two steps. In the first step, LEA discovers the positions of nearby network nodes and uses this information to emulate how they estimate the position of the mobile node. In the second step, it quantifies the level of exposure by computing the distance between the position estimated in the first step and its true position. We refer to these steps as a location-exposure problem. We tested our proposal with simulations and testbed experiments. These results show the ability of LEA to reproduce the location of the mobile node, as seen by the network, and to quantify the level of exposure. This knowledge can help the mobile user decide which actions should be performed before transmitting."

A fluid model of finite dimension is considered with leaks distributed equally throughout the pipeline. The analysis begins reformulating the multi-leak detection problem in the following way; each residual must be robust to one leak but sensitive to the others. The conclusion of the analysis shows that this reformulation fails in general if one assumes more than two leaks with fixed positions in the pipeline. This fact is proved using geometric tools and extending the necessary and sufficient conditions presented in (De-Persis and Isidori, 2001) to get a residual generator assuming one set of faults and one set of disturbances. In particular, the residual generators designed considering a nonlinear model and simulated data with two leaks show that both leaks are perfectly isolated. However, the residuals in the case of experimental data shown that a decision logic is required to isolate the leak, because of the leak uncertain position. © 2003 International Federation of Automatic Control."

The fulfillment of these conditions allows finding the analytical expression for the leak localization, which is the goal of the third stage.

The proposal is based on a demand pattern construction with repetitive multiple statistic models which allow detection through residual generation for each corresponding model. The key of the method is the time division of the pattern such that the demand satisfies the stationarity condition during each time interval. Thus, the sequential set of demand models allows the use of traditional multivariate statistical tool such as principal component analysis (PCA) for the monitoring of each interval in a sequential manner. Simulations with an academic network are used to test the performance of the proposal, and the results show a lower false alarm rate than the standard PCA."

We introduce and approach based on an ANN for object learning and recognition using a descriptive vector built on recurrent patterns. Experimental learning results using a fast camera are presented. Some simple parts (i.e. circular, squared and radiused-square) were used for comparing different connectionist models (Backpropagation, Perceptron and FuzzyARTMAP) and to select the appropriate model. Later during experiments, complex figures were learned using the chosen FuzzyARTMAP algorithm showing a 93.8% overall efficiency and 100% recognition rate with not so complex parts. Recognition times were lower than 1 ms, which clearly indicates the suitability of the approach to be implemented in robotic real-world operations. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

Thus, tailoring therapies against viral infections are central. In view of that, this article presents the scheduling of antiviral treatments for influenza A virus (IAV) infections based on neural networks and model predictive control (MPC). This hybrid intelligent approach calculates the current drug administration after using the differential evolution (DE) algorithm to establish a set of drug-intake times which maximizes the viral clearance while minimizing the drug consumption during a prediction horizon. Monte Carlo simulations reveal that the viral elimination achieved by the proposed strategy is similar to that obtained by the clinical recommendations. However, the amount of drug administrated by the algorithm is less than the current clinical recommendations. Thus, the potential of the proposed algorithm to schedule treatments in influenza and other infections is discussed. © 2019 Elsevier B.V."

However, CT-based cardiac diagnosis requires manual segmentation of heart cavities, which is a difficult and time-consuming task. Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel technique to segment endocardium and epicardium boundaries based on a 2D approach. The proposal computes relevant information of the left ventricle and its adjacent structures using the Hermite transform. The novelty of the work is that the information is combined with active shape models and level sets to improve the segmentation. Our database consists of mid-third slices selected from 28 volumes manually segmented by expert physicians. The segmentation is assessed using Dice coefficient and Hausdorff distance. In addition, we introduce a novel metric called Ray Feature error to evaluate our method. The results show that the proposal accurately discriminates cardiac tissue.

Fetal cardiac function can be assessed by performing some measurements regarding the dimension and shape of the heart cavities. In this work we propose an automatic segmentation method applied to the analysis of the left ventricle in fetal echocardiography. Methods: For segmentation of the left ventricle, we designed a novel multi-texture active appearance model (AAM) based on the Hermite transform (HT). Local orientation analysis is addressed by steering the coefficients obtained with the HT. The method basically consists of an AAM-based scheme which uses the steered HT to efficiently code texture patterns of the input image. A wider and detailed description of the image features can be obtained with this method. Compared with classic AAM methods, the segmentation performance is substantially improved with the proposed scheme. Since AAM-based approaches process local information, an automatic method is also proposed to initialize the multi-texture AAM. For this purpose, a database of pre-segmented images was built. Then, techniques such as thresholding, mathematical morphology and correlation are combined to identify the position and orientation of the left ventricle. Typical issues found in fetal cardiac ultrasound images such as different orientations and shape variations of the heart cavities can be easily handled with the designed method. Results: Several images of fetal echocardiography were used to evaluate the proposed segmentation method. The algorithm performance was validated using different metrics. We used a database of 143 real images of fetal hearts acquired for different phases of the cardiac cycle. We obtained an average Dice coefficient of 0.8631 and a point-to-curve distance of 2.027 pixels. The proposed algorithm was also validated by comparing it with other segmentation methods. Conclusions: We have designed an automatic algorithm for left ventricle segmentation in fetal echocardiography. The reported results demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve an efficient segmentation of the left ventricular cavity. Typical problems found in images of fetal echocardiography are satisfactorily handled with the proposedmulti-textureAAM scheme. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved."

We discuss the limitations of current mutation rate heuristics, showing that any fixed mutation rate can be expected to be suboptimal in terms of balancing exploration and exploitation. We then develop a mutation rate heuristic that offers a better balance by assigning different mutation rates to different subpopulations. When the mutation rate is assigned through a ranking of the population, according to fitness for example, we call the resulting algorithm a Rank GA. We show how this Rank GA overcomes the limitations of other heuristics on a set of model problems showing under what circumstances it might be expected to outperform a SGA with any choice of mutation rate."

How can these n processes communicate to solve a problem? It is shown that linear number of Multi-Writer Multi-Reader (MWMR) registers are sufficient to solve any read-write wait-free solvable problem and needed to solve some read-write wait-free solvable problem. This contrasts with the existing possible solution borrowed from adaptive algorithms that require  MWMR registers. To obtain the sufficiency result, the paper shows how the processes can non-blocking emulate a system of n Single-Writer Multi-Reader (SWMR) registers on top of n Multi-Writer Multi-Reader (MWMR) registers. For the necessity result, it shows it is impossible to do such an emulation with  MWMR registers. The paper also presents a wait-free emulation, using  rather than just n registers. The emulation can be used to solve an infinite sequence of tasks that are sequentially dependent (processes need the previous tasks outputs in order to proceed to the next task). A non-blocking emulation cannot be used in this case, because it might starve a process forever."

Although it has become a key element of the systems where it was introduced several decades ago, there is insufficient information to determine its role on biological interactions. To elucidate water hyacinth–littoral zooplankton–planktivorous fish interactions, we conducted habitat choice experiments in the absence and presence of fish chemical cues (kairomones) for two tropical littoral cladocerans, Chydorus brevilabris and Simocephalus vetulus. We classified habitat selection as a habitat (preference for the plant without predation risk) and/or as a refuge (preference for the plant with predation risk). Our results showed that E. crassipes is used as a habitat by C. brevilabris and as a refuge by S. vetulus against fish predation. Although C. brevilabris did not use the water hyacinth as a refuge in the presence of kairomones, the results suggested that both C. brevilabris and S. vetulus exhibited behavioral responses that further reduced their predation risk. To our knowledge, this study is the first experimental evidence for littoral cladocerans using free-floating macrophytes as a refuge against fish predation in tropical systems. Our results support the assertion that habitat association is not necessarily an evidence of habitat preference. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland."

According to this thesis: (a) living is information processing, in which memory is maintained by both molecular states and ecological states as well as the more obvious nucleic acid coding; (b) this information processing has one overall function-to perpetuate itself; and (c) the processing method is filtration (cognition) of, and synthesis of, information at lower levels to appear at higher levels in complex systems (emergence). We show how information patterns, are united by the creation of mutual context, generating persistent consequences, to result in 'functional information'. This constructive process forms arbitrarily large complexes of information, the combined effects of which include the functions of life. Molecules and simple organisms have already been measured in terms of functional information content; we show how quantification may be extended to each level of organisation up to the ecological. In terms of a computer analogy, life is both the data and the program and its biochemical structure is the way the information is embodied. This idea supports the seamless integration of life at all scales with the physical universe. The innovation reported here is essentially to integrate these ideas, basing information on the 'general definition' of information, rather than simply the statistics of information, thereby explaining how functional information operates throughout life."

A locality property called projection-closed is identified. This property completely characterizes tasks that are wait-free checkable, where a task is said to be checkable if there exists a distributed algorithm that, given and , determines whether , i.e., whether is a valid output for according to the specification of . Projection-closed tasks are proved to form a rich class of tasks. In particular, determining whether a projection-closed task is wait-free solvable is shown to be undecidable. A stronger notion of locality is identified by considering tasks whose outputs look identical to the inputs at every process: a task is said to be locality-preserving if is a covering complex of . We show that this topological property yields obstacles for wait-free solvability different in nature from the classical impossibility results. On the other hand, locality-preserving tasks are projection-closed, and thus they are wait-free checkable. A classification of locality-preserving tasks in term of their relative computational power is provided. This is achieved by defining a correspondence between subgroups of the edgepath group of an input complex and locality-preserving tasks. This correspondence enables to demonstrate the existence of hierarchies of locality-preserving tasks, each one containing, at the top, the universal task (induced by the universal covering complex), and, at the bottom, the trivial identity task."

It therefore has good potential for promoting fairly immediate and impressive results even among beginners with no previous programming experience. However, the very features that make it easier for non-programmers to understand a program also make it easier for them to overestimate its meaning. For instance, the meaning that mnemonically chosen predicates suggest to a human reader, may easily be attributed to the set of clauses defining it, even when the clauses themselves do not imply it. In other words, untrained programmers tend to read into a program more than it actually says.

Nowadays, deployment of wind turbines has become extremely important and long-term estimation of the produced power entails a challenge to achieve good prediction accuracy for site assessment, economic feasibility analysis, farm dispatch, and system operation. We present a method for long-term wind power forecasting using wind turbine properties, statistics, and genetic programming. First, due to the high degree of intermittency of wind speed, we characterize it with Weibull probability distributions and consider wind speed data of time intervals corresponding to prediction horizons of 30, 25, 20, 15 and 10 days ahead. Second, we perform the prediction of a wind speed distribution with genetic programming using the parameters of the Weibull distribution and other relevant meteorological variables. Third, the estimation of wind power is obtained by integrating the forecasted wind velocity distribution into the wind turbine power curve. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method, we present a case study for a location in Mexico with low wind speeds. Estimation results are promising when compared against real data, as shown by MAE and MAPE forecasting metrics. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

They utilize coordinated head and flagellar movements to swim long distances within the female reproductive tract in order to find and fertilize the egg. However, to date, long-term analysis of the sperm head-flagellar movements, or indeed those of other flagellated microorganisms, remains elusive due to limitations in microscopy and flagellar-tracking techniques. Here, we present a novel methodology based on local orientation and isotropy of bio-images to obtain long-term kinematic and physiological parameters of individual free-swimming spermatozoa without requiring image segmentation (thresholding). This computerassisted segmentation-free method evaluates, for the first time, characteristics of the head movement and flagellar beating for up to 9.2 min. We demonstrate its powerful use by showing how releasing Ca2+ from internal stores significantly alters long-term sperm behavior.

They utilize coordinated head and flagellar movements to swim long distances within the female reproductive tract in order to find and fertilize the egg. However, to date, long-term analysis of the sperm head-flagellar movements, or indeed those of other flagellated microorganisms, remains elusive due to limitations in microscopy and flagellar-tracking techniques. Here, we present a novel methodology based on local orientation and isotropy of bio-images to obtain long-term kinematic and physiological parameters of individual free-swimming spermatozoa without requiring image segmentation (thresholding). This computerassisted segmentation-free method evaluates, for the first time, characteristics of the head movement and flagellar beating for up to 9.2 min. We demonstrate its powerful use by showing how releasing Ca2+ from internal stores significantly alters long-term sperm behavior.

Despite its importance, we are still lacking an objective and broadly applicable approach for identification of number and position of developmental domains or zones along the longitudinal axis of the root apex or boundaries between them, which is essential for understanding the mechanisms underlying cell proliferation, elongation and differentiation dynamics during root development. • Methods We used a statistics approach, the multiple structural change algorithm (MSC), for estimating the number and position of developmental transitions in the growing portion of the root apex. Once the positions of the transitions between domains and zones were determined, linear models were used to estimate the critical size of dividing cells (LcritD) and other parameters. • Key Results The MSC approach enabled identification of three discrete regions in the growing parts of the root that correspond to the proliferation domain (PD), the transition domain (TD) and the elongation zone (EZ). Simultaneous application of the MSC approach and G2-to-M transition (CycB1;1DB:GFP) and endoreduplication (pCCS52A1:GUS) molecular markers confirmed the presence and position of the TD. We also found that the MADS-box gene XAANTAL1 (XAL1) is required for the wild-type (wt) PD increase in length during the first 2 weeks of growth. Contrary to wt, in the xal1 loss-of-function mutant the increase and acceleration of root growth were not detected. We also found alterations in LcritD in xal1 compared with wt, which was associated with longer cell cycle duration in the mutant. • Conclusions The MSC approach is a useful, objective and versatile tool for identification of the PD, TD and EZ and boundaries between them in the root apices and can be used for the phenotyping of different genetic backgrounds, experimental treatments or developmental changes within a genotype.

Stereo web-cameras perform marker based motion capture to obtain rigid head motion and non-rigid facial expression motion. Acquired 3D points are then mapped onto a 3D face model with a virtual muscle animation to create face expressions. Muscle inverse kinematics updates muscle contraction parameters based on marker motion to create the character’s performance. Advantages of the system are reduced character creation time by using virtual muscles and a dynamic skin model, a novel way of applying markers to a face animation system, and its low cost hardware requirements, capable of running on standard hardware and making it suitable for interactive media in end-user environments."

The brain can remember these experiences and, simultaneously, estimate the timing between events. To understand the mechanisms underlying working memory and time encoding, we analyze neural activity recorded during delays in four experiments on nonhuman primates. To disambiguate potential mechanisms, we propose two analyses, namely, decoding the passage of time from neural data and computing the cumulative dimensionality of the neural trajectory over time. Time can be decoded with high precision in tasks where timing information is relevant and with lower precision when irrelevant for performing the task. Neural trajectories are always observed to be low-dimensional. In addition, our results further constrain the mechanisms underlying time encoding as we find that the linear “ramping” component of each neuron’s firing rate strongly contributes to the slow timescale variations that make decoding time possible. These constraints rule out working memory models that rely on constant, sustained activity and neural networks with high-dimensional trajectories, like reservoir networks. Instead, recurrent networks trained with backpropagation capture the time-encoding properties and the dimensionality observed in the data. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved."

Generally, the sequences are a set of samples following a specific order, like a time-based process or a structured dataset. This type of neural network is very efficient for exploring sequences patterns and other relevant features highlighting temporal behavior and dependencies. This is accomplished because the information loops within the different stages of the network, and in this process, it remembers and tracks features at different segments of the data. In this work, we are interested in exploring how an RNN based on Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) units behaves in a classification problem when the dataset of sequences are organized in different order and lengths. That is, the same information is presented to the network, but the order of the samples within the sequences and the length of the sequences are different in each experiment. In order to evaluate this effect, we used five datasets of grayscale images of 28   ×  28 pixels (MNIST, MNIST-C, notMNIST, FashionMNIST, and Sign Language MNIST). For every experiment, we segmented the images in different sizes and orders and built a set of sequences consisting of vectors of pixels organized following three different rules, and on each case, we set the sequences to a specifically fixed length. The results bring to light that good accuracies can be achieved for different sequences configurations. We considered the 28   ×  28 configuration as the baseline for reference. We found that this baseline generally leads to high accuracies, but for some datasets it is not the best one. We believe that this study may be useful for video tagging and for general image description."

The proposed model is based on a modification to the well-known LuGre friction model; it is simpler than other models already suggested in the literature and offers a similar level of accuracy. To validate the proposed model, experimental tests applying controlled and random displacements and currents on a commercial damper were performed. Parameter identification algorithms were then used to fit the parameters that better describe the dynamic behavior of the damper. The identification scheme includes a closed-loop observer to estimate the internal state of the friction model. Results demonstrate very good model performance and indicate that the proposed model can be readily used in the design of semi-active control algorithms, state observers and on-line parameter identification schemes."

However, the need to cover greater areas at higher transmission speeds gave rise to the 802. 16x standards. These new standards provide the necessary guidelines that establish coverage, transmission capacities, types and quality of services. The technologies required to implement the 802. 16x standards, however, are much more costly than traditional WLANs.

Design/methodology/approach - The performance of industrial robots working in unstructured environments can be improved using visual perception and learning techniques. The object recognition is accomplished using an artificial neural network (ANN) architecture which receives a descriptive vector called CFD&POSE as the input. Experimental results were done within a manufacturing cell and assembly parts. Findings - Find this vector represents an innovative methodology for classification and identification of pieces in robotic tasks, obtaining fast recognition and pose estimation information in real time. The vector compresses 3D object data from assembly parts and it is invariant to scale, rotation and orientation, and it also supports a wide range of illumination levels. Research limitations/implications - Provides vision guidance in assembly tasks, current work addresses the use of ANN's for assembly and object recognition separately, future work is oriented to use the same neural controller for all different sensorial modes. Practical implications - Intelligent manufacturing cells developed with multimodal sensor capabilities, might use this methodology for future industrial applications including robotics fixtureless assembly. The approach in combination with the fast learning capability of ART networks indicates the suitability for industrial robot applications as it is demonstrated through experimental results. Originality/value - This paper introduces a novel method which uses collections of 2D images to obtain a very fast feature data - ""current frame descriptor vector"" - of an object by using image projections and canonical forms geometry grouping for invariant object recognition. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

In recent years this research has begun to be inflected by rapid advances in measurement techniques that are delivering chronological data with unprecedented accuracy. Patterns are emerging from the accumulating evidence whose precise interpretation demands corresponding advances in theory. It seems that cave painting went through several transitions, beginning with the creation of simple lines, dots and disks, followed by hand stencils, then by outlined figures, and finally by naturalistic figures. So far the most systematic evidence comes from Europe, although there are also indications that this sequence could be a universal pattern. The shamanic hypothesis provides a useful theoretical starting point because of its emphasis on the role of performance and phenomenology in the creative process. However, it still tends to reduce this sequence to mere stylistic and thematic changes that were external products of an already fully formed modern mind. Here I show how key insights from semiotics and material engagement theory can advance this explanatory framework to the extent that we become able to postdict the major transitions in the chronology of Paleolithic cave painting. An intriguing implication is that this is at the same time a chronology of cognitive changes, namely from a performative-phenomenological to a reflective-representational mind."

The system has been designed to assist a radiologist during breast biopsy, and also as a training system for radiology residents. Algorithms for automatic image analysis, were implemented in order to detect microcalcifications or tumors on digital mammography images. We report the development of the system prototype, tested on a physical phantom of a breast with a tumor, made of polivinil alcohol. We also report the results of automatic detection of microcalcifications and tumors on digital mammography images."

In order to address the issue of data quality, and challenging the presumptions of perfection, atomicity and primary authorship, a toolset has been developed. This project proposes a data quality manager (DQM), which contains a reference model, a measurement model along with an assessment model. The present work aims to identify data quality criteria to measure and assess data quality of derived data, as well as data at multiple levels of granularity. The qualitative information provided by the DQM is enhanced by considering data provenance. The qualitative measures allow the ranking of data sources based on users' specification of the context in a heterogeneous multi-database environment. The DQM prototype has been tested and several experiments have been carried out in order to prove that more accurate information is being provided to the users.

High resolution imagery is needed for mapping and characterization purposes, due to the areal extent of urban forests, parks and recreational areas. Fusion techniques of panchromatic (1m resolution) and multiband (4m resolution) IKONOS data were used for mapping and characterization of land covering characteristics of urban green areas, allowing the identification of parks, tree areas and fields with a minimal mapping unit of 160 m 2. Techniques, that integrate the fine details of the input data into the fused image, are used. Experimental results for different image fusion methods (Laplacian, Gradient pyramids, Principal Component Analysis and Wavelet transform) are also demonstrated in order to improve spatial resolution. Classification of urban areas, mapped with fused data, results in higher accuracies than when using a multiband approach with 4 m data alone. Furthermore, high spatial resolution data permitted to obtain new areal extents of green areas of the city, giving a better estimate of international indicators for a suitable green areas policy. Vegetation indexes derived from red and near infrared data IKONOS are used to evaluate vegetation conditions, which, along with their distribution, location and urban context, resulted in better indicators of green areas."

The images studied in our work correspond to different-sized lagoons located in areas with high and low topography in a tropical region of Chiapas, Mexico. Our research project delineates SWB and MSWB. For this analysis, we considered water bodies to be uniform regions in a synthetic aperture radar image. The robustness of the method was determined based on an analysis of the morphologies of 23 lagoons. Several methods, including Hermite transform, were analyzed and compared with other image denoising methods used to improve speckle reduction. To obtain additional spatial information for image classification, we analyzed texture using the gray-level co-occurrence matrix. The results indicate that the Hermite filter is the best method for identifying water bodies. The advantage of this filter is the identification of local patterns such as edges and lines. It also preserves and improves aspects related to the homogeneity of water bodies, using the Hermite coefficient selection criteria for local pattern feature selection/extraction. The lake water extent products demonstrate that Sentinel-1 is useful for identifying SWB in this study area. The results show very high detection of water bodies, with adequate detection for water bodies larger than 2 ha, and an area accuracy of 80%.

In order to obtain the DHT referred to a rotated coordinate system the set of coefficients of a given order are mapped through a unitary transformation based on the generalized binomial function. This representation allows a perceptual classification, including constant patterns (0-D), oriented structures (1-D), and non-oriented structures (2-D). Classification is based on light adaptation and contrast masking properties of the human vision. Finally, classification is improved by means of a probabilistic approach based on Markov Random Fields."

It is very difficult to master, yet it arises all over modern computing systems, both when the communication medium is shared memory and when it is by message passing. Concurrent programming is hard because it requires to cope with many possible, unpredictable behaviors of communicating processes interacting with each other. Right from the start in the 1960s, the main way of dealing with concurrency has been by reduction to sequential reasoning. We trace this history, and illustrate it through several examples, from early ideas based on mutual exclusion, passing through consensus and concurrent objects, until today ledgers and blockchains. We conclude with a discussion on the limits that this approach encounters, related to fault-tolerance, performance, and inherently concurrent problems."

My aim on this paper is defending this thesis against Macbeth’s [24, 25, 26] claim that if diagrams were pictures their content could not shift the way it does in Euclidean proof. To this goal I will present a broadly Gricean account of pictorial representation, where visual resemblance constraints but no fully determines reference, and then show how this account ratifies Macbeth’s insights about the importance of the author’s intentions in determining a diagram’s content, in a way that allows for the sort of content-shifting that she has identified as key to understanding the role of diagrams in Euclidean proof."

Most of the energy efficient routing algorithms try to improve the network lifetime but it lacks to guarantee the life time of individual nodes in the network. A novel and an optimal routing protocol Max-Min-Path (MMP) have been proposed that guarantee to maximize the network lifetime which is NP-hard problem. This routing strategy remains sustainable even in a non-monotonic sequence of the energy path cost and the residual energy of the individual nodes and, thereby enhancing the network lifetime with low computational complexity. A classical relationship between the total energy path and the residual energy of individual nodes has been proved. The simulation results prove that the proposed work outperforms the existing energy-efficient routing algorithms by evaluating the energy-aware performance metrics."

A region growing algorithm is performed from local maxima regions taken as seeds to get the final results. A set of 20 retinal images selected and manually tagged by a retinal specialist ophthalmologist were used for the evaluation. Results present a true positive rate (TPR) of 0.627 and a specificity SPC of 0.979. It is demonstrated that Mean shift filtering is a promising method for exudates detection."

The work proposed here improves and extends to the measure of discrete compactness from 2D (two dimensional) domain to 3D. The measure of discrete compactness proposed here corresponds to the sum of the contact surface areas of the face-connected voxels of 3D shapes. A relation between the area of the surface enclosing the volume and the contact surface area, is presented. The concept of contact surfaces is extended to 3D shapes composed of different polyhedrons, which divide space generating different 3D lattices. The measure proposed here of discrete compactness is invariant under translation, rotation, and scaling. In this work, the term of compactness does not refer to point-set topology, but is related to intrinsic properties of objects. Finally, in order to prove our measure of compactness, we calculate the measures of discrete compactness of different volcanos (which are compared with their classical measures) from the valley of Mexico using Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data."

The resulting systems are inherently complex, which makes their development and characterization a challenge for traditional methods. Here we propose the design and analysis of adaptive P2P systems using measures of complexity, emergence, self-organization, and homeostasis based on information theory. These measures allow the evaluation of adaptive P2P systems and thus can be used to guide their design. We evaluate the proposal with a P2P computing system provided with adaptation mechanisms. We show the evolution of the system with static and also changing workload, using different fitness functions. When the adaptive plan forces the system to converge to a predefined performance level, the nodes may result in highly unstable configurations, which correspond to a high variance in time of the measured complexity. Conversely, if the adaptive plan is less aggressive, the system may be more stable, but the optimal performance may not be achieved."

This analysis uses a hybrid calorimeter which includes simultaneously the mixing-chamber (MC) and the breath by breath (BbB) IC techniques. VO2 and VCO2 short-term variability was characterized as metabolic variability in the MC technique by intra-group standard deviation averages. When the BbB technique was used the metabolic variability characterization was done by VO2 and VCO2 discrete time series power spectrum analysis in the 0-0.5 Hz band. Thus a statistical population of 17 young healthy volunteers was studied using a clino-ortho maneuver with 30-30 minutes in each position after 8 hours of fasting. The results showed an energy expenditure change of 40% in Kcal/day (p&lt;0.01). The metabolic variability was partially significant using the MC technique while BbB total power spectrum changed from 35 to 60 for the VO2 and from 24 to 37 for the VCO2 (ml/bth) 2, (p&lt;0.05) in the region from 0 to 0.04 Hz.

Variances and low frequency power spectrums (0-0.5 Hz) are use to measure the MV activity. The hypothesis is proved measuring the MV in a population of 17 young volunteers subdue the clino-ortho maneuver. The test protocol was adapted using 30 minutes of data acquisition to include both mixing chamber and breath by breath ICT. Subjects were measured after 8 hours of fasting. The results showed a MV increment from 32.5 to 40 ml/min (p<0.01) for de VO2 standard deviation with none significance change for de the VCO2 using the mixing chamber ICT. Analogously the ICT breath by breath MV showed a total power spectrum change from 34.9 to 60 (ml/bth)2 for the VO2 and from 24 to 37 (ml/bth)2 for the VCO2 (p<0.05), mainly in the frequency region from 0.01 to 0.03 Hz. Therefore, it was concluded that breath by breath MV was approximately 3 times more relevant than the mixing chamber MV with the possibility to evidence metabolic control mechanism. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007."

This fact together with the evidence that midbrain is associated with Parkinson's disease has led researchers to consider midbrain segmentation as an important issue. Nowadays, Active Shape Models (ASM) are widely used in literature for organ segmentation where the shape is an important discriminant feature. Nevertheless, this approach is based on the assumption that objects of interest are usually located on strong edges. Such a limitation may lead to a final shape far from the actual shape model. This paper proposes a novel method based on the combined use of ASM and Local Binary Patterns for segmenting midbrain. Furthermore, we analyzed several LBP methods and evaluated their performance. The joint-model considers both global and local statistics to improve final adjustments. The results showed that our proposal performs substantially better than the ASM algorithm and provides better segmentation measurements."

The method is based on three state observers; each one with a specific assigned task. The aim of the first state observer (the orientation observer) is to indicate whether the leak is to the left (upstream) or to the right (downstream) of the branch. Depending on the indication of the orientation observer, one of the other two state observers (the locating observers) can be used to estimate the position of the leak. The three observers are based on second-order models that were built from the so-called rigid water column model of a pipeline and hydraulic gradient relations."

Each process   pi  is given an input value   xi , and the processes should collectively decide whether their set of input values   x=(xi)i  is a valid state of the system w.r.t. to some specification, i.e., if   x∈L . In non-deterministic distributed decision each process   pi  gets a local certificate   ci  in addition to its input   xi . If the input   x∈L  then there exists a certificate   c=(ci)i  such that the processes collectively accept x, and if   x∉L , then for every c, the processes should collectively reject x. The collective decision is expressed by the set of opinions emitted by the processes. In this paper we study non-deterministic distributed decision in systems where asynchronous processes may crash. It is known that the number of opinions needed to deterministically decide a language can grow with n, the number of processes in the system. We prove that every distributed language   L  can be non-deterministically decided using only three opinions, with certificates of size   ⌈logα(n)⌉+1  bits, where   α  grows at least as slowly as the inverse of the Ackerman function. The result is optimal, as we show that there are distributed languages that cannot be decided using just two opinions, even with arbitrarily large certificates. To prove our upper bound, we introduce the notion of distributed encoding of the integers, that provides an explicit construction of a long bad sequence in the well-quasi-ordering   ({0,1}∗,≤∗)  controlled by the successor function. Thus, we provide a new class of applications for well-quasi-orderings that lies outside logic and complexity theory. For the lower bound we use combinatorial topology techniques."

To prove our result, we first generalize the well known result that any orthogonal polygon in the plane with n vertices has (n + 4)/2 convex and (n−4)/2 reflex vertices; see [1,2]. We prove that an orthogonal polyhedron of genus g with n vertices, k of which have degree greater than or equal to 4, has (n+8−8g +3k)/2 convex vertices and (n − 8 + 8g − 3k)/2 reflex vertices.

Open- and Short-circuit switch faults can be diagnosed by the Fault Detection and Isolation (FDI) algorithm suggested in this study. A decoupled subsystem from the load and PV currents is obtained for residual generation, which is guaranteed at the price of 2 measurements, namely, PV current and load voltage. Hence, the FDI system is insensitive to load changes and sudden irradiance drops. According to observability properties of this subsystem, the fault detection time can be assigned arbitrarily. In addition, operation of the FDI system in open- and closed-loop has been evaluated through a prototype of 350 W. Only the most common measurements employed into the Maximum Power Point searching techniques are required in the proposed FDI system. Finally, as an important result, the proposed FDI system can be applied over the most common PV applications due to the residual generation system is decoupled from load conditions."

To achieve this, we first provide a formal semantics of the models. Using this semantics and methods for modeling sequential programs we obtain small Kripke structures. When considering the logics, we need to extend this to handle external variables and the possibilities of those variables been affected at any time during the execution of the sequential finite state machine. Thus, we extend the construction of the Kripke structure to this case. As a proof of concept, we use a classical example of modeling a microwave behavior and producing the corresponding software directly from models. The construction of the Kripke structure has been implemented using flex, bison and C++, and properties are verified using NuSMV."

In this particular problem of modelling, Genetic Programming has proved to be an efficient alternative and has produced interesting results. However, it has been showed that, based on traditional GP representation (Koza-style), solutions tend to be complex in their structure and translation into problem domain turns difficult. Thus, the aim of the MB-GP is to reduce the complexity, producing simple models and estimating coefficients by means of an ordinary least squares fitting method. This approach is then tested on recorded data of a gas turbine engine systems, comparing its performance and complexity against previous work. Copyrigth (C) 2003 IFAC"

Transport authorities have implemented several strategies to reduce traffic jams with varying degrees of success. The use of reversible lanes is a common approach to improve traffic congestion during rush hours. A reversible lane can change its direction during a time interval to the more congested direction. This strategy can improve traffic congestion in specific scenarios. Most reversible lanes in urban roads are fixed in time and number; however, traffic patterns in cities are highly variable and unpredictable due to this phenomenon's complex nature. Therefore, reversible lanes may not improve traffic flow under certain circumstances; moreover, they could worsen it because of traffic fluctuations. In this paper, we use cellular automata to model adaptive reversible lanes(aka dynamic reversible lanes). Adaptive reversible lanes can change their direction using real-time information to respond to traffic demand fluctuations. Using real traffic data, our model shows that adaptive reversible lanes can improve traffic flow up to 40% compared to conventional reversible lanes. Our results show that there are significant fluctuations in traffic flow even during rush hours, and thus cities would benefit from implementing adaptive reversible lanes."

However, before LTE can be widely used in this context, a number of analyses must provide convincing evidence that critical network functions (e.g. resource allocation strategies) yield adequate performance. To this end, in this work, we introduce a Markov-chain based model for LTE downlink channel quality, a prime factor affecting performance. Our model comes from the analysis of a large number of measurements of LTE Cell-Specific Reference Signals that were collected through a crowdsourcing application on a motorway in the UK. The model is intended to be used in performance evaluation studies and we exemplify its use with a case study, where we estimate the downlink transmission capacity of an LTE network.

We found a special synergy between social hierarchy and communal ritual: only their combination improved the extent of social coordination, whereas the introduction of centralization and top-down influence by themselves had no effect.

Experimental evidence and simulation studies suggest that dopamine neuron activity serves as an effective reinforcement signal for learning of sensorimotor associations in striatal matrisomes. In the current study, we simulate dopamine neuron activity with the extended temporal difference model of Pavlovian learning and examine the influences of this signal on medium spiny neurons in striatal matrisomes. The modeled influences include transient membrane effects of dopamine D1 receptor activation, dopamine-dependent long-term adaptations of corticostriatal transmission, and effects of dopamine on rhythmic fluctuations of the membrane potential between an elevated ""up-state"" and a hyperpolarized ""down-state"". The most dominant activity in the striatal matrisomes is assumed to elicit behaviors via projections from the basal ganglia to the thalamus and the cortex. This ""standard model"" performs successfully when tested for sensorimotor learning and goal-directed behavior (planning). To investigate the contributions of our model assumptions to learning and planning, we test the performance of several model variants that lack one of these mechanisms. These simulations show that the adaptation of the dopamine-like signal is necessary for sensorimotor learning and planning. Sensorimotor learning requires dopamine-dependent long-term adaptation of corticostriatal transmission. Lack of dopamine-like novelty responses decreases the number of exploratory acts, which impairs planning capabilities. The model loses its planning capabilities if the dopamine-like signal is simulated with the original temporal difference model, because the original temporal difference model does not form novel associative chains. Transient membrane effects of the dopamine-like signal on striatal firing substantially shorten the reaction time in the planning task. The capability for planning is improved by influences of dopamine on the durations of membrane potential fluctuations and by manipulations that prolong the reaction time of the model. These results suggest that responses of dopamine neurons to conditioned stimuli contribute to sensorimotor reward learning, novelty responses of dopamine neurons stimulate exploration, and transient dopamine membrane effects are important for planning. © 2001 IBRO."

We also discussed the importance of the dynamical interplay between the risk factors and the network of interdependencies that characterizes the biochemical, cellular, and tissue-level biomolecular reactions that underlie the physiological processes in health and disease. As we pointed out in the previous chapter, the understanding of this interplay (articulated around cellular phenotypic plasticity properties, regulated by specific kinds of gene regulatory networks) is necessary if prevention is chosen as the human-health improvement strategy (potentially involving the modulation of the patient’s lifestyle).

The main feature of the model is to present an action view of dialogue. CGS model dialogue as an inter-action, this is a sequence of acts performed by two or more agents in a common environment. We claim that CGS are able to model dialogue with a high degree of flexibility, which means that they are able to accept new concepts and modify rules, protocols and settings during the computation. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC."

In this paper we remark that conversation can be somehow understood as a parallel interaction between agents. P systems, which are by definition parallel devices, provide a suitable framework to model such non-standard conversational phenomena. Two parallel events in dialogue: immediate reply and overlapping are explained from a realistic pragmatic perspective, and formal descriptions for them are introduced."

Instead of modeling a light source we model a wireless device whose radio signal can penetrate a given number k of walls.

We show that every monotone polygon with n vertices can be illuminated with  k-modems. In addition, we exhibit examples of monotone polygons requiring at least  k-modems to be illuminated. For monotone orthogonal polygons with n vertices we show that for  and for even k, every such polygon can be illuminated with  k-modems, while for odd ,  k-modems are always sufficient.

However, most RBN studies have been made with random topologies, while real regulatory networks have been found to be modular. In this work, we extend classical RBNs to define modular RBNs. Statistical experiments and analytical results show that modularity has a strong effect on the properties of RBNs. In particular, modular RBNs have more attractors, and are closer to criticality when chaotic dynamics would be expected, than classical RBNs."

The main purpose of the work is to test the performance of these instruments working in a closed space, similar to the one found in the field where they will be installed. Transmitters are carried by the studied species, and the receivers are placed inside artificial reefs with the purpose to detect the presence of the species while they are inside. Results have shown that the hydrophone located farther away from the walls is the one with better performance, in relation to those installed close to the walls. The same behavior has been observed on transmitters, the one which is located in the center of the pond was better detected."

The term tepetate includes fragipans, duripans, pedosediments and saprolites, derived from vitric rhyolitic tuff, Pleistocene volcanic ashes or pyroclastic flows. All soils with tepetates are at high risk of erosion and so they have been intensively studied for decades. The tepetates are common in Tlaxcala State of central Mexico, being formed under Ustic Isomesic soil climate. The aim of this investigation was to characterise the pore space of fragipan-type tepetates and the role of clay components in their formation. We studied porosity of tepetate from a tephra-palaeosol sequence in the north of Tlaxcala State, in undisturbed soil samples. Observations of pore space were made in 2D and 3D by analysing microscope images of thin sections and cross-sectional images from a computed tomography scanner. In the thin sections we also identified and described clay illuvial pedofeatures. Micromorphological observations showed two main pore types. Small rounded pores had a homogeneous distribution and were probably formed before the clay illuviation process that took place in a palaeosol formed on the tepetate material. The distribution pattern of the small pores in the studied tepetate was similar to that in the fragic horizon, which was probably formed by a hydro-consolidation process. Large crack-pores were formed during the palaeosol formation. Later these large pores were filled by illuvial clay coatings and so we conclude that each tepetate was part of the set of Bt horizons in the palaeosols of Luvisol type."

This pattern of diet effect is similar to that noted at the same ages in the prior studies of the granule cell dendrites (Brain, Res., 1990; 532:271-277, J. Comp. Neurol, 1991; 310:356-364). This similarity of effects at these loci suggests that the diet effects on the hippocampal trisynaptic circuit are closely linked to each other. In all loci the effect of the diet was most marked on P220, indicating the late appearance of dietary deprivation effects in the hippocampal formation."

We review the literature and argue that the two traditionally competing replicator-first and metabolism-first approaches are merging into one integrated theory of individuation and evolution. We contribute to the maturation of this more inclusive approach by highlighting some problematic assumptions that still lead to an ximpoverished conception of the phenomenon of life. In particular, we argue that the new consensus has so far failed to consider the relevance of intermediate time scales. We propose that an adequate theory of life must account for the fact that all living beings are situated in at least four distinct time scales, which are typically associated with metabolism, motility, development, and evolution. In this view, self-movement, adaptive behavior, and morphological changes could have already been present at the origin of life. In order to illustrate this possibility, we analyze a minimal model of lifelike phenomena, namely, of precarious, individuated, dissipative structures that can be found in simple reaction-diffusion systems. Based on our analysis, we suggest that processes on intermediate time scales could have already been operative in prebiotic systems. They may have facilitated and constrained changes occurring in the faster- and slower-paced time scales of chemical self-individuation and evolution by natural selection, respectively."

Gaussian-derivative operators have long been used in computer vision for feature extraction and are relevant in visual system modeling. A directional energy is defined in terms of the 1-D Hermite transform coefficients of local projections. Each projection is described by the Hermite transform, resulting in a directional derivative analysis of the input at a given spatiotemporal scale. We demonstrate that the 1-D Hermite transform coefficients of local projections are readily computed as a linear mapping of the 3-D Hermite transform coefficients through some projecting functions. The directional response is used to detect spatiotemporal patterns that are 1-D or 2-D. Practical consideration and experimental results are also of concern."

However, a far more serious location privacy threat arises when malicious eavesdroppers listen to wireless transmissions from an unsuspecting mobile user in order to pinpoint his location and figure out his identity. This new scenario is known as location estimation (LE). While there are several strategies to mitigate the threats posed by LBS scenarios, only a few researchers deal with countermeasures for LE scenarios. This paper proposes MSP, a MAC Swapping Protocol that allows two mobile users to discreetly exchange their MAC addresses without malicious eavesdroppers being able to detect it. In this way, although potential eavesdroppers can still pinpoint the location of a transmitting node, they will get its identity wrong. Over time, MSP eliminates the eavesdroppers’ ability to link the position and identity of a transmitting source. In contrast to related research, the identity exchange in MSP takes into account information from the mobile users’ physical and MAC layers simultaneously, so an attack in one layer does not expose the identity exchange in the other layer. In order to provide location privacy, MSP uses two algorithms. The first algorithm works at the physical layer, allowing two mobile nodes to decide when and where to exchange their MAC addresses. The second algorithm uses virtual interfaces to guarantee that the identity exchange does not exhibit any abnormal behavior at the MAC layer.

However, one of the main drawbacks of GP is the fact that individuals tend to grow in size through the evolution process without a significant improvement in individual performance. In Multi-Branches Genetic Programming (MBGP), an individual is composed of several branches, each branch can evolve a part of individual solution, and final solution is composed of the integration of these partial solutions."

The performance of leakage detection and localization methods highly depends on the amount, type and placement of the sensors installed in the network. Sensor placement is a challenging task considering the demand uncertainties, measurement noise, and varying leakage size. While some sensor placement methods have been designed to maximize leakage detection, others have been developed for leakage localization. In practice, both tasks are relevant. Thus, the goal of obtaining a sensor configuration that establishes a compromise between leak detection and localization errors is considered here. The sensor placement task is then formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. A real-life and large-scale network that represents a version of the distribution system of the Modena city is used as a case study with synthetically generated data. The feasibility of the proposal is demonstrated for scenarios with demand uncertainty, measurements noise and varying leakage size."

The concurrent use of multiple sensors for recognition of human activities in AmI is a good practice because the information missed by one sensor can sometimes be provided by the others and many works have shown an accuracy improvement compared to single sensors. However, there are many different ways of integrating the information of each sensor and almost every author reporting sensor fusion for activity recognition uses a different variant or combination of fusion methods, so the need for clear guidelines and generalizations in sensor data integration seems evident. In this survey we review, following a classification, the many fusion methods for information acquired from sensors that have been proposed in the literature for activity recognition; we examine their relative merits, either as they are reported and sometimes even replicated and a comparison of these methods is made, as well as an assessment of the trends in the area."

The fusion algorithm is based on the Hermite transform, which is an image representation model based on Gaussian derivatives that mimic some of the most important properties of human vision. Moreover, rotation of the Hermite coefficients allows efficient detection and reconstruction of oriented image patterns in reconstruction applications such as fusion and noise reduction. We show image fusion with different image sensors, namely synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and multispectral optical images. This case is important mainly because SAR sensors can obtain information independently of weather conditions; however, the characteristic noise (speckle) present in SAR images possesses serious limitations to the fusion process. Therefore noise reduction is a key point in the problem of image fusion. In our case, we combine fusion with speckle reduction in order to discriminate relevant information from noise in the SAR images. The local analysis properties of the Hermite transform help fusion and noise reduction adapt to the local image orientation and content. This is especially useful considering the multiplicative nature of speckle in SAR images."

There have been many research efforts towards parallelizing dynamic programs. In this paper, we study the parallelization of the Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme (PTAS) DP for the classical bin-packing problem. This problem is challenging due to the fact that the number of dimensions of the DP table is not known a priori and is dependent on the input and the accuracy desired by the user. We present optimization techniques for parallelizing the DP for this problem, which include diagonalization, blocking and optimizing dependency lookups. We perform a comprehensive evaluation of our parallel DP on a multicore platform and show that the parallel DP scales well and that our proposed optimizations lead to further substantial improvement in performance."

The one-dimensional Gauss-Kronrod adaptive method is generalized to 3, 4, 5 and 6 dimensions. The implementation of the traditional tensor product construction of the grid and weights for multidimensional integration is revisited and reformulated taking advantages of the multi and many-core architectures. Tests performed in a set of benchmark functions show that the algorithm is numerically accurate, with accelerations as high as 800X in CUDA and 300X in the OpenMP implementation both compared to a sequential multidimensional integration algorithm."

In this paper, we use multidimensional scaling to study the perceptual factors that influence the quality impression of Computed Tomography (CT) images processed by a noise-reduction technique. We also characterize intersubject differences in the assessment of image attributes. We show that multidimensional scaling can be used reliably for the characterization of the subjective performance of image-processing algorithms.

This paper presents a multimodel agent-based simulation technique based on the incorporation of multiple modules. Two key principles are presented to guide this integration: a common abstract space where entities of different models interact, and commonly controlled agents—abstract actors operating in the common space, which can be handled by different agent-based models. In order to test the proposed methodology, we run a set of simulations of cinema building evacuation using the general-purpose PULSE simulation environment. In this paper we utilize crowd pressure as a metric to estimate the capacity of different emergent conditions to traumatically affect pedestrians in the crowd. The proposed approach is evaluated through a series of experiments simulating the emergency evacuation from a cinema building to the city streets, where building and street levels are reproduced in heterogeneous models. This approach paves the way for modeling realistic city-wide evacuations."

Our approach is based on two ideas. Firstly, we have taken inspiration from graph-GP representations. With this idea we decided to explore the possibility of representing programs as graphs with oriented links. Secondly, our individuals could have more than one output. This idea was inspired on the divide and conquer principle, a program is decomposed in subprograms, and so, we are expecting to make the original problem easier by breaking down a problem into two or more sub-problems. To verify the effectiveness of our approach, we have used several evolvable hardware problems of different complexity taken from the literature. Our results indicate that our approach has a better overall performance in terms of consistency to reach feasible solutions."

It also allows the construction of pyramidal mutirresolution analysis-synthesis schemes. We show how the Hermite Transform can be used to build image fusion schemes that take advantage of the fact that Gaussian derivatives are good operators for the detection of relevant image patterns at different spatial scales. These patterns are later combined in the transform coefficient domain. Applications of this fusion algorithm are shown with remote sensing images, namely LANDSAT, IKONOS, RADARSAT and SAR AeS-1 images."

First we fuse multispectral images from the same satellite (Landsat ETM+) with different spatial resolutions. In this case we show how the proposed method can help improve spatial resolution. In the second case, we fuse multispectral Landsat ETM+ and SAR images combining with a speckle reduction method for the latter. Both algorithms are based on a Gaussian-derivative image transform. This is a multi-channel model for image representation based on the scale-space theory. Moreover, locally rotating the image transform allows better edge reconstruction and restoration from noise. We show that multispectral image fusion with the Hermite Transform preserves the biophysical variable interpretation of the original images."

A bench is the usual binary consensus problem for 2 processes. Assume n+1 processes want to sit in n benches as follows. Each one starts with a preference, consisting of a bench and one place (left or right) in the bench where it wants to sit. Each process should produce as output the place of the bench where it decides to sit. It is required that no two processes sit in different places of the same bench. Upon the observance of a conflict in one of the benches an undecided process can “abandon” its initial bench and place and try to sit in another bench at another place. The musical benches problem is so called because processes jump from bench to bench trying to find one in which they may be alone or not in conflict with one another. If at most one process starts in each bench, the problem is trivially solvable– each process stays in its place. We show that if there is just one bench where two processes rather than one, start, the problem is wait-free unsolvable in read/write shared memory. This impossibility establishes a new connection between distributed computing and topology, via the Borsuk-Ulam theorem. The musical benches problem seems like just a collection of consensus problems, where by the pigeon hole principle at least one of them will have to be solved by two processes. Consequently, one is tempted to try to find a bivalency impossibility proof of the FLP style. Our second result shows that there is no such proof: We present an algorithm to solve the musical benches problem using set agreement, a primitive stronger than read/write registers, but weaker than consensus. Thus, an FLP-style impossibility for musical benches will imply an FLP-style impossibility of set-consensus. The musical benches problem can be generalized by considering benches other than consensus, such as set agreement or renaming, leading to a very interesting class of new problems."

We investigate the problem in a natural setting: for the communications between processors, they only share several queues supporting enqueue and dequeue operations. It is well-known that there is a very simple algorithm using only one queue when the queue also supports the peek operation, but it is still open whether we could implement mutual exclusion distributed system without the peek operation. In this paper, we propose two mutual exclusion starvation-free algorithms for this more restricted setting. The first algorithm is a protocol for arbitrary number of processors which share 2 queues; the second one is a protocol for 2 processors sharing only one queue."

Manipulating unstable systems requires task-specific anticipatory dynamics. Learning this dynamics is more difficult when tasks, such as carrying liquid or riding a horse, produce unpredictable, irregular patterns of feedback and have hidden dimensions not projected as sensory feedback. We addressed the issue of coordination with complex systems producing irregular behaviour, with the assumption that mutual coordination allows for non-periodic processes to synchronize and in doing so to become regular. Chaos control gives formal expression to this: chaos can be stabilized onto periodic trajectories provided that the structure of the driving input takes into account the causal structure of the controlled system. Can we learn chaos control in a sensorimotor task? Three groups practiced an auditory-motor synchronization task by matching their continuously sonified hand movements to sonified tutors: a sinusoid served as a Non-Interactive Predictable tutor (NI-P), a chaotic system stood for a Non-Interactive Unpredictable tutor (NI-U), and the same system weakly driven by the participant’s movement stood for an Interactive Unpredictable tutor (I-U). We found that synchronization, dynamic similarity, and causal interaction increased with practice in I-U. Our findings have implications for current efforts to find more adequate ways of controlling complex adaptive systems."

To reach this objective, we established the amount of cells presenting nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and the amygdaline concentrations in the L-arginine-nitric oxide synthesis pathway. A group of fully epileptic rats, induced by the kindling procedure and that had reached at least 10 generalized seizures, was studied. We evaluated behavioral stages, electroencephalographic activities, and histochemical NOS-positive cells and carried out highpressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) determi. nations of arginine, citrulline, and glutamic acid. Our results showed that behavioral and electrographic frequency, and duration of epileptic activities, were increased during the kindling process. Image processing system of NOS cells showed two types of intensities in cell stains in hippocampus, caudate-putamen, and amygdala. When we independently counted the two types of NOS stain cells, a selective increase in the number and density of weak-stained cells was observed, while darkstained cells did not change in the studied structures. Additionally, arginine, citrulline, and glutamic acid concentrations in amygdala increased in kindled animals. The differential and specific increase in the stained cells expressing the nitric oxide synthase, as well as the increase in concentra- tions of the L-arginine-nitric oxide pathway in amygdala, suggested a relationship with the progressive augmentation in the electrophysiological hyperactivity characteristic of generalized epilepsy."

Because only a limited portion of the network is flooded by control packets near the source and destination nodes, NARD can significantly reduce the signaling overhead of route discovery compared with blind flooding techniques. Simulations with NS2 were undertaken to verify the validity of our approach."

Objective: To propose a multidimensional methodology in order to obtain the scientometric profile of the National Cancer Institute (INCan), Mexico, and rank it with regard to other national health institutions. Method: Using the LabSOM software and the ViBlioSOM methodology based on artificial neural networks, the INCan scientific production indexed in the Web of Science from 2007 to 2017 was analyzed. The multidimensional scientometric profile of the Institute was obtained and compared with that of other national health institutions. Results: In terms of productivity, INCan ranks fourth among the 10 Mexican public health institutions indexed in the Web of Science; in the normalized impact ranking, it ranks sixth. Although out of 1323 articles 683 (51.62 %) did not receive citations, 11 articles classified as excellent (0.83 %) obtained 24 % of 11,932 citations and, consequently, INCan normalized impact rate showed a mean productivity higher than the world mean. Conclusion: Multidimensional analysis with the proposed neural network enables obtaining a more reliable and comprehensive absolute and relative institutional scientiometric profile than that derived from measuring isolated variables. © 2019 Academia Nacional de Medicina de México, A.C.

16631,Neighbor Discovery in a Sensor Network with Directional Antennae,2016,Sergio Rajsbaum Gorodezky,Instituto de Matemáticas (IM),,,1551-9899,,,RS,Telecommunications; Computer Science,Deterministic; randomized algorithms; neighbor discovery; rotating directional antennae; sensor network,"Consider a network of n directional antennae in the plane. We consider the problem of efficient neighbor discovery in a (synchronous) network of sensors employing directional antennae. In this setting sensors send messages and listen for messages by directing their antennae towards a specific direction (which is not necessarily known in advance). In our model the directional antennae can be rotated by the sensors as required so as to discover all neighbors in their vicinity. In this paper we will limit ourselves to the (D, D) communication profile whereby sensors employ directional antennae with identical transmission/reception beam widths. Our methodology is based on techniques for symmetry breaking so as to enable sender/receiver communication. We provide 1) deterministic algorithms that introduce delay in the rotation of the antennae and exploit knowledge of the existence of a vertex coloring of the network, and 2) randomized algorithms that require knowledge only of an upper bound on the size of the network so as to accomplish neighbor discovery. In both instances we study tradeoffs on the efficiency of the algorithms proposed. Through experimentation, we also show that the algorithms achieve desirable neighbor discovery delays and the randomized algorithms perform better in the simulation."

In the last years, NEPs have demonstrated their generating and accepting power, as well as a good capacity for solving hard computational problems. Whereas complexity results support the accuracy of the framework, different variants have been introduced in order to achieve several computational properties. In the future, NEPs can also be used as a model for research in other fields."

The previous model is centered on the representation of the regulatory regions upstream of genes, and their internal organization in the DNA. This paper is centered in discussing some alternatives related to the representation of the organization of operons and their alternative states of transcription, as active or inactive units of transcription. Transformational rules can be used to describe the binding and unbinding of regulatory proteins, and the associated representations of (ON/OFF) gene expression. The initial representation of a regulated promoter is linked to that of the operon encoding its regulatory protein. In this way the representation of a regulated operon depends on that of all others regulating its transcription, enabling in principle the encoding of regulatory networks within an expanded grammatical model of gene regulation.

It has recently been demonstrated that combining Hebbian learning with occasional alterations of normal neural states avoids this problem by means of self-organized enlargement of the best basins of attraction. However, so far it is not clear to what extent this process of self-optimization is also operative in real brains. Here we demonstrate that it can be transferred to more biologically plausible neural networks by implementing a self-optimizing spiking neural network model. In addition, by using this spiking neural network to emulate a Hopfield network with Hebbian learning, we attempt to make a connection between rate-based and temporal coding based neural systems. Although further work is required to make this model more realistic, it already suggests that the efficacy of the self-optimizing process is independent from the simplifying assumptions of a conventional Hopfield network. We also discuss natural and cultural processes that could be responsible for occasional alteration of neural firing patterns in actual brains. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd."

This cellular domain includes a large diversity of organisms characterized as prokaryotes with basal transcriptional machinery similar to eukarya. In this work we explore the most recent findings concerning the transcriptional regulatory organization in archaeal genomes since the perspective of the DNA-binding transcription factors (TFs), such as the high proportion of archaeal TFs homologous to bacteria, the apparent deficit of TFs, only comparable to the proportion of TFs in parasites or intracellular pathogenic bacteria, suggesting a deficit in this class of proteins. We discuss an appealing hypothesis to explain the apparent deficit of TFs in archaea, based on their characteristics, such as their small length sizes. The hypothesis suggests that a large fraction of these small-sized TFs could supply the deficit of TFs in archaea, by forming different combinations of monomers similar to that observed in eukaryotic transcriptional machinery, where a wide diversity of protein–protein interactions could act as mediators of regulatory feedback, indicating a chimera of bacterial and eukaryotic TFs’ functionality. Finally, we discuss how global experiments can help to understand in a global context the role of TFs in these organisms."

16692,Nobility targeting raids among the Classic Maya Cooperation in scale free networks persists under tournament attack when population size fluctuates,2016,Tom Froese,Instituto de Investigaciones en Matemáticas Aplicadas y en Sistemas (IIMAS),Instituto de Ciencias Nucleares (ICN),,,,,IA,Archaeology; Computer Science,INTERNET,"Cooperation in scale-free networks has proven to be very robust against removal of randomly selected nodes (error) but highly sensitive to removal of the most connected nodes ( attack). In this paper we analyze two comparable types of node removal in which the removal selection is based on tournaments where the fittest (raids) or the least fit (battles) nodes are chosen. We associate the two removals to two types of Maya warfare offences during the Classic period. During this period of at least 500 years, political leaders were able to sustain social order in spite of attack-like offences to their social networks. We present a computational model with a population fluctuation mechanism that operates under an evolutionary game theoretic approach using the Prisoner's Dilemma as a metaphor of cooperation. We find that paradoxically battles are able to uphold cooperation under moderate levels of raids, although raids do have a strong impact on the network structure. We infer that cooperation does not depend as much on the structure as it does on the underlying mechanism that allows the network to readjust. We relate the results to the Maya Classic period, concluding that Mayan warfare by itself cannot entirely explain the Maya political collapse without appealing to other factors that increased the pressures against cooperation."

The algorithms are based on a recently developed technique for image representation called a polynomial transform. With this technique it is possible to decompose the image into local components, perform nonlinear and adaptive processing on these components, and resynthesize the image from the processed components. In this paper we describe how this can be applied to adapt the amount of noise reduction to the local image content. In the first algorithm, a single polynomial transform is used to perform the noise reduction. A critical parameter of this algorithm is the size of the local components. No single size is optimal for the entire image, so a compromise has to be made. An alternative approach is adopted in the second algorithm, where several polynomial transforms are used in parallel at different resolutions. This allows for a better adaptation of the size of the image components used in the reconstruction to the original image. For instance, uniform regions containing only noise are described with large-sized components. Low-contrast edges are restored with medium-sized components, while high-contrast edges contain high-resolution components. © 1992."

It is shown that this non-ferrite circuit based on the non-reciprocal behaviour of microwave transistor amplifiers generates explementary phases between adjacent coupled oscillators. Thus, this coupling network can be used to increase the array stability while extending the achievable scanning range. Numerical simulations of a multistage coupling network have shown the possibility of obtaining non-reciprocal coupling phases up to ±180° with transmission coefficients better than -2 dB. The circuit is also useful for compensating the reciprocal coupling effect between the antenna elements. It has been shown numerically that a multistage coupling network leads to non-reciprocal coupling phases up to ±180° with transmission coefficients better than -7.5 dB for a weakly COA of patch antennas at 10 GHz. A single-stage circuit with non-reciprocal coupling phases of ±175° was designed, fabricated and tested. Numerical simulations of the circuit show non-reciprocal coupling phases of +179.5° and -175.1° at 10 GHz, while measured results show non-reciprocal coupling phases of +172.7° and -168.6° at 9.920 GHz. © 2011 The Institution of Engineering and Technology."

The objective of this work was to estimate accumulated annual rainfall events in northwestern Mexico based on different return periods and future scenarios. Three non-stationary models were proposed for seven probability functions related to minimum values. The models were validated for series with statistical characteristics that change over time. A total of 221 accumulated annual rainfall series were evaluated, of which 36 (16%) were determined to be non-stationary. For these series, non-stationary models better represented the variability of the data than conventional models. A decrease in annual mean rainfall under 20% is predicted by the year 2044 at stations located on the California peninsula (Sonora and Sinaloa). The results suggest that these areas will be more vulnerable to future droughts."

The first approach is based on operation valency, and it allows us to make an important distinction between trivial and nontrivial helping. We show that any wait-free implementation of a queue from Test&Set requires nontrivial helping. We also define a weaker type of nontrivial helping and show that any wait-free queue implementation from a set of arbitrary base objects requires it. In contrast, there is a wait-free implementation of a stack from Test&Set with only trivial helping. These results shed light on the well-known open question of whether there exists a wait-free implementation of a queue in Common2, and indicate why it seems to be more difficult than implementing a stack. The other approach formalizes the helping mechanism employed by Herlihy’s universal wait-free construction and is based on having an operation by one process restrict the possible linearizations of operations by other processes. We show that queue and stack implementations possessing such universal helping can be used to solve consensus. This result can be used to show that a strongly linearizable (Golab et al., 2011) implementation of a queue or a stack for  processes must use objects that allow to solve consensus among  or more processes."

In traditional RPC systems, when a remote procedure call fails to return result to the client because of communication failure, client stub usually reinvokes the remote method for expected output if the method is idempotent. This results in repeated marshalling of same data multiple times which is a burden over network if the data is huge. For the first time, we prevent this repeated marshalling by introducing a behavioral pattern that we refer to as usually synchronous, but conditionally asynchronous RPC (CA-RPC). CA-RPC establishes handshaking between client stub and server stub to understand whether connection was failed after demarshalling of data at server stub. If so, the client stub runs a pulling thread to retrieve the result without remarshalling the same data. Besides that, our strategy enhances the performance by a synchrony switch at runtime under some condition. Our results show that CA-RPC has better performance than traditional RPC for cases where data marshalling has significant overhead over low rate data connections."

The location task is formulated as a classification problem, and it is simplified by applying a clustering strategy. Data from each class are formed by measurements associated with leakages that occur within a specific zone of the WDN. A zone is defined as a set of nodes that share similar topological properties. Therefore, clustering is performed for network partitioning. Sensors are then placed within the network for maximizing leak detection coverage, and data of each class are generated by using the EPANET hydraulic simulator. The robustness of the proposal is demonstrated for different kinds of uncertainties and measurements’ noise. A real-life network is used as case study with synthetically generated field data. The proposal achieves an improved performance for the different scenarios in comparison with the node location approach."

The mathematical model governing mass, momentum and energy transport was established containing three coupled partial differential equations. These governing equations were numerically solved by discretizing time and space with backward finite differences, leading to one implicit scheme at every time step. The numerical solution was validated with available lab data obtaining good agreement. We present relevant results as the time behavior of upstream and downstream flow and pressure, while varying the leak location. Besides, we also show the temperature, pressure and flow profiles along the pipe when the leak is located near the inlet and outlet of the pipe. The predictive capabilities of the numerical model are remarkable to simulate the transient state of volumetric flow rate and pressure when a single leak is provoked at the pipe. A future application of our numerical scheme is for rapid automatic detection of loss of containment in pipes transporting valuable fluids as, for instance: oil, refined hydrocarbons, fuel, liquid catalysts, etc."

There are several approaches to try to solve the so-called wetting and drying problem, that is, the determination of the shape of the flooded area. In this article, an adaptive curvilinear method for the numeric simulation of the process of wetting and drying in shallow water flows is presented and evaluated. The changes in the shape of the physical space are obtained using an Euler-Lagrangian approach that considers the adaptation of the computational grid according to water level elevation. The system of partial differential equations that describe the depth-averaged flow, including the change in the form of the domain due to the wetting and drying phenomenon, is based on the method of fractional steps; the two-dimensional non-linear system of the hydrodynamic equations is split in a group of three-diagonal linear equations that are solved using an alternating direction approach. Using experimental data, the proposed approach is validated. The agreement between the numerical and experimental results is very satisfactory."

Basically, this function evaluates the robots performance when it goes from an origin to a destination, and the grading of the robot evaluates also that the robots behavior using RNN is similar to the behavior generated by a potential fields approach for navigation. Our objective was to prove that GA is a good option as a method for finding behaviors for mobile robots’ navigation and also that these behaviors can be implemented using RNN."

Measurements of oil drops and air bubbles were obtained using an image analysis system coupled to a mixing tank. Complex interactions of the phases involved could be clearly observed. The Sauter diameter and the size distributions of drops and bubbles were affected by the morphological type of biomass (pellets or dispersed mycelia) added to the system. Larger oil drop sizes were obtained with dispersed mycelia than with pellets, as a result of the high apparent viscosity of the broth, which caused a drop in the power drawn, reducing oil drop break-up. Unexpectedly, bubble sizes observed with dispersed mycelia were smaller than with pellets, a phenomenon which can be explained by the segregation occurring at high biomass concentrations with the dispersed mycelia. Very complex oil drops were produced, containing air bubbles and a high number of structures likely consisting of small water droplets. Bubble location was influenced by biomass morphology. The percentage (in volume) of oil-trapped bubbles increased (from 32 to 80%) as dispersed mycelia concentration increased.

Measurements of oil drops and air bubbles were obtained using an image analysis system coupled to a mixing tank. Complex interactions of the phases involved could be clearly observed. The Sauter diameter and the size distributions of drops and bubbles were affected by the morphological type of biomass (pellets or dispersed mycelia) added to the system. Larger oil drop sizes were obtained with dispersed mycelia than with pellets, as a result of the high apparent viscosity of the broth, which caused a drop in the power drawn, reducing oil drop break-up. Unexpectedly, bubble sizes observed with dispersed mycelia were smaller than with pellets, a phenomenon which can be explained by the segregation occurring at high biomass concentrations with the dispersed mycelia. Very complex oil drops were produced, containing air bubbles and a high number of structures likely consisting of small water droplets. Bubble location was influenced by biomass morphology. The percentage (in volume) of oil-trapped bubbles increased (from 32 to 80%) as dispersed mycelia concentration increased. A practically constant (32%) percentage of oil-trapped bubbles was observed with pelleted morphology at all biomass concentrations. The results evidenced the high complexity of phases interactions and the importance of mycelial morphology in such processes."

In this paper we show that if Nis sufficiently large, then Scontains a monochromatic triangle with vertices in Sand containing at most c-3points in its interior (c≥4). The particular case c=4solves the conjecture of Basu, Bhattacharya, and Das in [6]. For the case of two colors, it is still unknown whether every sufficiently large bichromatic point set contains an empty monochromatic convex quadrilateral [11]. In this direction we show that if Sis sufficiently large, then it always contains a convex monochromatic quadrilateral with at most 2c-3points in its interior (c≥2). We also show a general result on the number of empty convex quadrilaterals with disjoint interiors. Let Pbe a set of npoints in general position. It is straightforward to see that if the elements of Pare the vertices of a convex polygon, n≥4, Palways has n-32empty convex quadrilaterals with disjoint interiors. In this paper we prove that any point set Pin general position has at least n-32interior disjoint empty convex quadrilaterals. We also give direct consequences of this theorem related to simultaneously flippable edges in triangulations and convex decompositions of point sets. We show that for any point set Pthere is always a triangulation that has n-32simultaneously flippable edges.

To be effective in complex unstructured environments, robots have to perceive the environment and adapt accordingly. In this paper it is discussed a biology inspired approach based on the adaptive resonance theory (ART) and implemented on an KUKA KR15 industrial robot during real-world operations (e.g. assembly operations). The approach intends to embed naturally the skill learning capability during manufacturing operations (i.e., within a flexible manufacturing system). The integration of machine vision and force sensing has been useful to demonstrate the usefulness of the cognitive architecture to acquire knowledge and to effectively use it to improve its behaviour. Practical results are presented, showing that the robot is able to recognise a given component and to carry out the assembly. Adaptability is validated by using different component geometry during assemblies and also through skill learning which is shown by the robot's dexterity. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

It is generally assumed that, as soon as a violation of the property is revealed by any of the monitors at runtime, some recovery code can be executed for bringing the system back to a legal state. This implicitly assumes that each monitor produces a binary opinion, true or false, and that the recovery code is launched as soon as one of these opinions is equal to false. In this paper, we formally prove that, in a failure-prone asynchronous computing model, there are correctness properties for which there is no such decentralized monitoring. We show that there exist some properties which, in order to be monitored in a wait-free decentralized manner, inherently require that the monitors produce a number of opinions larger than two. More specifically, our main result is that, for every k, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, there exists a property that requires at least k opinions to be monitored by n monitors. We also present a corresponding distributed monitor using at most k + 1 opinions, showing that our lower bound is nearly tight."

Helvenston and Bahn have tried to refute the most famous hypothesis, Lewis-Williams' neuropsychological model, by claiming that appropriate visual hallucinations required the ingestion of LSD, psilocybin, or mescaline, while arguing that none of these compounds were available to the cultures in question. We present here mycological arguments that tell another story. A prehistoric worldwide distribution of the mushroom genus Psilocybe, and therefore of psilocybin, is supported by the existence of endemic species in America, Africa, and Europe, the disjunct distribution of sister species, and the possibility of long-distance spore dispersal. It is more difficult to point to instances of actual prehistoric ritual use in Africa and Europe, but there are a growing number of suggestive findings."

Rajsbaum (1990) under the assumption that message transmission delays and processing times are constant. We study the behavior of the simple synchronizer when processing times and transmission delays are random. The main performance measure is the rate of a network, i.e., the average number of computational steps executed by a processor in the network per unit time. We analyze the effect of the topology and the probability distributions of the random variables on the behavior of the network. For random variables with exponential distribution, we provide tight (i.e., attainable) bounds and study the effect of a bottleneck processor on the rate.<>"

A requirement of sense-making is adaptivity, i.e., the agent's capacity to actively monitor and regulate its own trajectories with respect to its viability constraints. However, there are examples of sense-making, known as ultrafast cognition, that occur faster than the time physiologically required for the organism to centrally monitor and regulate movements, for example, via long-range neural feedback mechanisms. These examples open a clarificatory challenge for the enactive approach with respect to how to operationalize monitoring and regulation, and with respect to the temporal scale of sense-making, which has traditionally been limited to the here-and-now in accordance with the axiom of structural determinism. We explore possible responses to this challenge and suggest that this axiom should be explicitly rejected, in particular, we suggest that adaptivity is a property of organism-environment interactions over a time span that includes both present and past conditions. Ultrafast performances are thus no longer a challenge for the enactive approach, because the constitutive basis of their normativity is spatiotemporally extensive. This is in agreement with recent developments in different varieties of enactivism, which all converge toward assigning a constitutive role to an agent's history of interactions."

Therefore, it is important to determine the influence of the bioreactor operational parameters (stirring speed, impeller type, power drawn, etc.) under which the culture achieves the highest yields. The automatic on-line analysis of multiphase dispersions occurring in microbial cultures in mechanically stirred bioreactors, presents a number of important problems for image acquisition and segmentation, including heterogeneous transparency of moving objects of interest and background, blurring, overlapping and artifacts. In this work, a Hough transform based method was implemented and tested. Results were compared with those obtained manually by the expert.

We briefly summarize the content of the workshops talks, and identify the main themes that emerged from the open discussions. Two important conclusions from the discussions are: (1) the idea of pluralism about OEE - it seems clear that there is more than one interesting and important kind of OEE; and (2) the importance of distinguishing observable behavioral hallmarks of systems undergoing OEE from hypothesized underlying mechanisms that explain why a system exhibits those hallmarks. We summarize the different hallmarks and mechanisms discussed during the workshop, and list the specific systems that were highlighted with respect to particular hallmarks and mechanisms. We conclude by identifying some of the most important open research questions about OEE that are apparent in light of the discussions. The York workshop provides a foundation for a follow-up OEE2 workshop taking place at the ALIFE XV conference in Cancún, Mexico, in July 2016.

The system exploits the different forms of intrinsic parallelism frequently associated to the process of ultrasonic imaging creating a flexible, modular and scalable test-bed for the implementation of existing methods and the development of new hardware architectures and processing algorithms. Transmission beam focusing, scanning techniques and efficient interpolation schemes are developed and applied in order to increase the spatial resolution of the constructed ultrasonic images. The algorithms are assessed and implemented in order to achieve a real-time response, a key goal in ultrasonic image applications. The flexibility and scalability characterized by the system allow to incorporate new developments in technology and to utilize more complex algorithms for improving the images visual appearance in real-time."

The cheapest way to increase the operating capacity of a system is, before any major investment, improving efficiency in resource utilization. Unlike previous studies in International Airport of Mexico City (IAMC), our approach involves using a real schedule of arrivals and departures to generate entities; the simulation model generates a specific aircraft type at a specific time with a possible earlier or later arrival time given by statistical distribution. We included the time of running in taxiways, with a specific speed. In the beginning, we respect the original gate allocation and it makes a difference between national and international flight, since the gates are different and have assigned different security rules. The purpose of this study is to analyze the behavior of the system, identify underutilized gates and propose new policies for assignment to a typical day in the passenger apron at the terminal T1 of IAMC. We choose the Simio® software to have direct visualization in 3D, real schedules also can be used to incorporate gate allocation policies in a very fast. In Mexico, there are very few airports simulations approaches, then, we intend to increase this topic using Simio® software in the IAMC."

Our proposal is based on the polynomial decomposition of each of the images using the steered Hermite transform as a representation of the local characteristics of images from an perceptual approach within a multiresolution scheme. The Hermite transform is a model that incorporates some of the more important properties of the first stages of the human visual system, such as the overlapping Gaussian receptive fields, the Gaussian derivative model of early vision and the multiresolution analysis. We propose an approach for optical flow estimation that incorporates image structure information extracted from the steered Hermite coefficients, that is later used as local motion constraints in a differential estimation method that involves several of the constraints seen in the current differential methods, which allows obtaining accurate flows. Considering the importance of understanding the movement of certain structures such as left ventricular and myocardial wall for better medical diagnosis, our main goal is to find an estimation method useful to assist diagnosis tasks in computer tomography images.

We study the production and reception of the cases of optical quantum entanglement most feasible to be observed: the two-photon spontaneous transition of the hydrogen 2 S-2(1/2) metastable level, which is known to be one of the components of the continuous spectra of ionized regions. We obtain the two-photon emission rate for four astrophysical objects: the Orion Nebula, two nearby planetary nebulae IC 2149 and NGC 7293, and the solar corona. The production of entangled pairs per second is 5.80 x 10(48), 9.39 x 10(45), 9.77 x 10(44), and 1.46 x 1.0(16) respectively. The distribution of the propagation directions of both emitted photons does not vanish at any angle; therefore it is possible to observe the entangled pair at angles theta approximate to 0 degrees. Because the number of two-photon coincidences goes as the fourth power of the ratio between the detector size and the distance from the astrophysical object, coincidences are scarce; for its detection we require receivers much larger than those currently available."

Clock synchronization algorithms are presented for a large family of delay assumptions. Our algorithms are modular and consist of three major components. The first component holds for any type of delay assumptions; the second component holds for a large, natural family of local delay assumptions; the third component must be tailored for each specific delay assumption. Optimal clock synchronization algorithms are derived for several types of delay assumptions by appropriately tuning the third component. The delay assumptions include lower and upper delay bounds, no bounds at all, and bounds on the difference of the delay in opposite directions. In addition, our model handles systems where some processors are connected by broadcast networks in which every message arrives at all the processors at approximately the same time. A composition theorem allows combinations of different assumptions for different links or even for the same link; such mixtures are common in practice. Our results achieve the best possible precision in each execution. This notion of optimality is stronger than the more common notion of worst-case optimality. The new notion of optimality applies to systems where the worst-case behavior of any clock synchronization algorithm is inherently unbounded."

We show that very universal heuristics, such as 1/N and the error threshold, can generally be improved upon if one has some qualitative information about the landscape. In particular, we show in the case of multiple optima (signals) how mutation affects which signal dominates and how passing between the dominance of one to another depends on the relative height and size of the peaks and their relative positions in the configuration space."

In the method presented here, a genetic algorithm (GA) is used for optimizing the potential field. The chromosome of each individual encodes parametrizations for the potential field generated by waypoints, obstacles, and goals. The waypoints themselves are obtained through a Voronoi tessellation of the environment in which the robot is operating. It is demonstrated that the algorithm allows a robot to navigate safely and efficiently through spaces with many obstacles, even in cases where these are placed in a strongly unfavorable way. Furthermore, the results from simulations were implemented successfully in an actual Khepera robot. Using a slightly simplified navigation procedure, in which the robot comes to a standstill between successive steps in the navigation, the Khepera robot managed to navigate through one of the most difficult environments used in the simulations. Finally, the paper briefly describes a different implementation of potential field navigation, in the path planning adaptation submodule of a more advanced simulated mobile robot (VirBot)."

We hypothesised that changes in soil architecture resulting from feedback mechanisms between management, soil organic carbon contents (SOC), biota and vegetation can be captured with X-ray computed tomography (CT), and that these affect the soil filtering function, which thus, can be manipulated through orchard management. We compared the transport of copper, a widely used fungicide, through intact soil cores from vine rows of kiwifruit orchards under organic and integrated management. We first derived 3D-macropore characteristics from CT-images, followed by leaching a pulse of copper and a tracer through the same cores. The organic orchard soil had a significantly higher SOC content than the integrated orchard soil, and this was positively correlated with total porosity. Macropores (>92 m) were larger with a higher connectivity, but significantly fewer in the organic than the integrated orchard soil. This resulted in a lower macroporosity and a better copper filtering capacity of the organic than the integrated orchard soil. Copper distribution was reasonably predicted when combining SOC contents, pH and macropore characteristics. Significant relationships between soil parameters and indicators of the strength of preferential flow verified that CT-derived macropore characteristics can be used to predict functional solute transport parameters. The relevance of our results and relationships observed between macropore characteristics, functional indicators of preferential flow and the fate of copper needs verification with samples representing more soils and sites."

The variable nature of the sequencing batch reactors, SBR, systems allows manipulation of the selective pressure on the microorganisms. Then, the activity of the community can be dynamically adjusted to meet changing effluents conditions. To improve the response of the SBR to changing influent conditions, several efforts have been made to automate and control the duration of the sequential phases of the SBR. The objective of this work is to present and discuss the feasibility of the use of the oxidation-reduction potential, ORP, as a control variable for the determination of the anaerobic phase length in an anaerobic-aerobic SBR used to degrade p-nitrophenol, PNP. The control of the anaerobic phase of the anaerobic-aerobic reactor was achieved with software developed at the Institute of Engineering-UNAM. During the anaerobic stage, the PNP is reduced to p-aminophenol, PAP. As a consequence of the compound transformation, there is a change in the oxidation-reduction potential of the culture medium. This change was used to indicate the minimal concentration of PNP and, as a consequence, the maximal PAP concentration. The feasibility of the algorithm for using the variations in the ORP to determine on-line the length of the anaerobic stage in an anaerobic-aerobic process was demonstrated in our laboratory."

The Cartesian to Configuration Space mapping is computationally intensive and this paper describes how the execution time can be decreased by using parallel processing. The natural tree structure of the algorithm is exploited to partition the computation into parallel tasks. An implementation programmed in the occamZ parallel computer language running on a network of INMOS transputers is described. The benefits of dynamically scheduling the tasks onto the processors are explained and verified by means of measured execution times on various processor network topologies. It is concluded that excellent speed-up and efficiency can be achieved provided that proper account is taken of the variable task lengths in the computation.

Equations for determining the unknown parameters can be written separately for the magnitude and the argument of the transfer function that simplifies the task of the identification. As a result, the problem can be reduced to the iterative solution of a system of algebraic equations."

Unfortunately, the use of different methods of observations/estimation and parametric identification is not without risk. This risk can be observed in term of accumulation of errors which can be considerable and more still, on the level of the total stability of the system. This article presents an original method allowing the observation/estimation of sates dynamics and parametric identification. This method is based on the approach of the High order sliding modes, with the application of the super-twisting algorithm and tested on a articulated heavy vehicle model."

In this work, we use them to explore the concept of the influence of a paper in a citation network. These functions depend on a parameter. By varying the parameter in a continuous way we explore different definitions of influence. We study six citation networks, three from physics and three from computer science. As a benchmark, we compare our results against two frequently used measures: the number of citations of a paper and the PageRank algorithm. We show that the ranking of the articles in a network can be varied from being equivalent to the ranking obtained from the number of citations to a behaviour tending to the eigenvector centrality, these limits correspond to small and large values of the communicability-function parameter, respectively. At an intermediate value of the parameter a PageRank-like behaviour is recovered. As a test case, we apply communicability functions to two sets of articles, where at least one author of each paper was awarded a Nobel Prize for the research presented in the corresponding article. © 2019 The authors 2019.

Lewis-Williams' neuropsychological model draws on these reports to gain insights into the minds of Paleolithic people, on the basis of shared neurobiology and given comparative ethnographic data on ritualized ASCs. Helvenston has long rejected this model because in many ASCs hallucinations do not always adhere to a strict 1-2-3 sequence, because they do not always feature animals, and because people do not always lose their critical faculties. She is right, but she is attacking a straw man because these criteria are her own. Helvenston's claims about the effects of psychoactive compounds and sensory deprivation are also questionable. It remains an open question how our Turing pattern model relates to more figurative forms of hallucinations."

The perfect failure detector provides accurate and eventually complete information about process failures. We show that, in asynchronous failure-prone message-passing systems, perfect failure detection can be achieved using an oracle that outputs at most [log alpha(n)] + 1 bits per process in n-process systems, where alpha denotes the inverse-Ackermann function. This result is essentially optimal, as we also show that, in the same environment, no failure detector outputting a constant number of bits per process can achieve perfect failure detection.

These indicators are revisited and extended as a set of three new metrics that can be used to evaluate and design flocks."

This system typically operates in very noisy environments; the noise, in this channel, is a combination of colored, narrow band and impulsive noises; it has also strong amplitude attenuations. The digital modulation frequently employed in power line communication to counteract the channel’s noise effects is the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing due to its high spectral efficiency and robustness in multipath fading environments; hence, it is also considered in our experimentation. We report the performance of turbo codes with the two types of interleavers: the high-spread random and the based quadratic permutation polynomial. The constituent codes are part of the 3GPP standard. Finally, it is used a punctured matrix in order to achieve a coding rate of 1/2. The performance is evaluated in terms of bit error rate, through the way of simulations."

For the objective evaluations we used several local and global measures of contrast and signal-to-noise ratio. For the subjective evaluation we used numerical scaling experiments assessing basic perceptual attributes. These are used to construct a multidimensional perceptual space subtended by perceptual attributes, namely noisiness, sharpness and contrast. These attributes, together with quality, are represented as vectors in the space. Results of the subjective evaluation show that quality of the processed images is mainly determined by the perception of noise, which in turn influences the perception of sharpness and contrast. The geometrical filter appears as the best filter in terms of objective measures, while the polynomial transform method is the best filter according to the subjective evaluation."

Using two wavelengths allows an increase of the dynamic range of the measurement. The main advantages are that even maintaining the correlation based scheme used by other authors, the time of processing should be reduced. Some experimental results are presented which show that for one wavelength a precision of 3 nm and a dynamic range of 316 nm are feasible for the red line of a He-Ne laser. For the two wavelength experiments a precision of 53 nm is obtained for λeq/2 = 1670 nm dynamic range."

The replating of chromaffin cells after trypsinization produced neurite growth in a manner similar to that of NGF. The combination of replating and NGF exposure did not induce phenotypic changes over and above those observed by NGF alone. The morphological changes are independent of the preliminary culture conditions. The results of this study demonstrate for the first time that simple replating of young chromaffin cells can induce neuronal traits indistinguishable from those observed with NGF. © 1995.

We use a directed graph G with n nodes, where arcs represent pipes and nodes represent locations. We also define a set L of r transportation orders and a subset F⊂L of further orders. A feasible solution to our model is a pumping sequence that delivers the products corresponding to all orders in L-F. We prove that the problem of finding such a solution is NP-hard, even if G is acyclic. For the special case where the products corresponding to orders in F are initially stored at nodes, we propose the BPA algorithm. This algorithm finds a feasible solution in O(r2 log r+s2 (rn+log s)) time, where s is the total volume in the arcs of G. We point out that the input size is Ω(s). If G is acyclic, then BPA finds a minimum cost solution"

With a human cultural history of nearly 12,000 years, the Tehuacan Valley is one of the main reservoirs of biocultural richness of Mexico, harboring archaeological remains with early signs of agriculture associated with forest management. Current peoples' subsistence is based on agriculture, livestock, and use of forest products, practicing productive systems with reminiscences of ancient practices. The Tehuacan Valley is a Biosphere Reserve, but some areas are affected by deforestation and overexploitation of natural resources. Identifying proposals for maintaining human culture and biodiversity are central issues of research and policies in the region, and we consider that agroforestry systems (AFS) may play important roles in such purposes. This study documented the conservation capacities of AFS and problems affecting them, analyzing plant species diversity in forests and AFS of rosetophyllous Izotal and Mexical forests, plant management influencing AFS composition, and factors influencing people's decisions about keeping plants inside their AFS. We recorded 113 plant species in the Izotal forest and 89 in the associated AFS, while 96 species in the Mexical forest and 64 in AFS. AFS maintain 76 and 88 % of the native species recorded in the Izotal and Mexical forests, respectively. Shannon diversity index in both forest types averaged 3.99 +/- 1.01, while average diversity in AFS was 3.36 +/- 0.99. AFS sampled in the Mexical have more vegetation cover because of the cultivation of Agave salmiana. The main agroforestry practices are fringes against soil erosion and the borders surrounding plots, where people leave plants standing, sow seeds and vegetative propagules of different species, transplant entire individuals, or cultivate others with special care. The reasons people decide to conduct these practices are mainly for shade, fodder, food, beverages allowing monetary incomes, fuelwood, material for construction, and aesthetic value. AFS maintain a high richness and diversity of plant species, but significantly, lower than forests. It is possible to enrich AFS composition and improve their contribution to regional strategies of biodiversity conservation and people's wealth. Manejo de plantas en sistemas agroforestales de bosques rosetfilos en el Valle de Tehuacan, Mexico. Con una historia cultural de cerca de 12,000 aos, el Valle de Tehuacan es uno de los principales reservorios de riqueza biocultural de Mexico, el cual ademas resguarda elementos arqueolgicos con signos tempranos de agricultura asociada al manejo forestal. La subsistencia de la gente actual se basa en la agricultura, la ganaderia y el uso de recursos forestales. Y en los sistemas productivos actuales es posible apreciar antiguas practicas de manejo. El Valle de Tehuacan es una Reserva de la Biosfera, sin embargo algunas areas son afectadas por la deforestacin y sobreexplotacin de recursos naturales. La bA(0)squeda de propuestas para mantener la armonia entre los requerimientos humanos y la biodiversidad es uno de los principales retos de la investigacin y diseo de politicas pA(0)blicas en la regin. Los sistemas agroforestales (SAF) pueden contribuir significativamente a estos propsitos. Este estudio documenta las capacidades de conservacin de los SAF y los problemas que los afectan, analizando el manejo de especies vegetales y la diversidad de plantas en bosques rosetfilos denominados izotal y mexical, y en los SAF que se construyen con base en su transformacin, las practicas de manejo para mantener plantas dentro de los SAF, asi como los factores que influencian las decisiones de la gente. Se registraron 113 especies de plantas en el izotal y 89 en el SAF asociado, mientras que se encontraron 96 especies en el mexical y 64 en el SAF asociado. Los SAF mantienen entre 76 y 88 % de las especies nativas registradas en los bosques de izotal y mexical, respectivamente. El indice de diversidad de Shannon en ambos tipos de bosques fue en promedio 3.99 +/- 1.01, mientras que en los SAF el promedio fue 3.36 +/- 0.99. Los SAF muestreados en el mexical tienen mayor cubierta vegetal debido al cultivo del maguey pulquero Agave salmiana. Las principales practicas agroforestales son las franjas contra la erosin de suelo, asi como los bordes de vegetacin que rodean las parcelas. En estas areas la gente deja en pie plantas del bosque, siembra semillas o propagulos vegetativos de otras, trasplanta individuos completos de algunas y cultiva otras con cuidados especiales. Las principales razones por las que la gente mantiene estas plantas son la procuracin de sombra, forraje, alimentos, produccin de pulque que asegura ingresos monetarios, material de construccin, lea, y valores est,ticos. Los SAF mantienen una alta riqueza y diversidad de especies de plantas nativas, aunque significativamente menor que la que existe en los bosques. Sin embargo, es posible enriquecer la composicin de los SAF y mejorar su contribucin a la conservacin de la biodiversidad regional y al mejoramiento de la calidad de vida de la gente."

However, at the level of transcriptional regulation little is known on a comparative scale. Here we address the question of the degree to which transcription factors (TFs) and their evolutionary families are shared between them. We found that 59 proteins and 28 families are shared between these two bacteria, whereas different subsets were lineage specific. We demonstrate that majority of the common families expand in a lineage-specific manner. More specifically, we found that AraC, ColD, Ebp, LuxR and LysR families are over-represented in E. coli, while ArsR, AsnC, MarR, MerR and TetR families have significantly expanded in B. subtilis. We introduce the notion of regulatory superfamilies based on an empirical number of functional categories regulated by them and show that these families are essentially different in the two bacteria. We further show that global regulators seem to be constrained to smaller regulatory families and generally originate from lineage-specific families. We find that although TF families may be conserved across genomes their functional roles might evolve in a lineage-specific manner and need not be conserved, indicating convergence to be an important phenomenon involved in the functional evolution of TFs of the same family. Although topologically the networks of transcriptional interactions among TF families are similar in both the genomes, we found that the players are different, suggesting different evolutionary origins for the transcriptional regulatory machinery in both bacteria. This study provides evidence from complete repertoires that not only novel families originate in different lineages but conserved TF families expand/contrast in a lineage-specific manner, and suggests that part of the global regulatory mechanisms might originate independently in different lineages.

In this paper we present an applied study of the state of the art in pattern recognition techniques to describe, analyze, and classify pollen grains in an extensive dataset specifically collected (15 types, 120 samples/type). We also propose a novel contour-inner segmentation of grains, improving 50% of accuracy. In addition to published morphological, statistical, and textural descriptors, we introduce a new descriptor to measure the grain's contour profile and a logGabor implementation not tested before for this purpose. We found a significant improvement for certain combinations of descriptors, providing an overall accuracy above 99%.

The paper also considers different types of additional assumptions that allow impossibility results to be circumvented. These assumptions are known under the names failure detectors and adversaries. Finally, it presents a powerful simulation technique (known under the name BG simulation), which allows to show that, from a computability point of view, t-resilience is not different from wait-freedom.

Assessment is based on an empirical approach: manually tagged data from a spoken-dialogue and video corpus are used in a CART-style machine learning algorithm to produce a predictive model. Our approach involves two general stages: the tagging task, and the development of machine learning experiments. In the first stage, human annotators produce dialogue act taggings using a formal methodology, obtaining a highly enough tagging agreement, measured with Kappa statistics. In the second stage, tagging data are used to generate decision trees. Preliminary results show that intonation information is useful to recognize sentence mood, and sentence mood and utterance duration data contribute to recognize dialogue act. Precision, recall and Kappa values of the predictive model are promising. Our model can contribute to improve automatic speech recognition or dialogue management systems."

17479,Prediction of spinal curve progression in Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis using Random Forest regression,2018,Fernando Arámbula Cosío,Instituto de Investigaciones en Matemáticas Aplicadas y en Sistemas (IIMAS),Instituto de Ciencias Aplicadas y Tecnología (ICAT),,0010-4825,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2018.09.029,,SIAV,Medicine; Artificial Intelligence,Prediction of spinal curve progression; Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis; Independent component analysis; Machine learning; Random forest,"Background: The progression of the spinal curve represents one of the major concerns in the assessment of Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS). The prediction of the shape of the spine from the first visit could guide the management of AIS and provide the right treatment to prevent curve progression. Method In this work, we propose a novel approach based on a statistical generative model to predict the shape variation of the spinal curve from the first visit. A spinal curve progression approach is learned using 3D spine models generated from retrospective biplanar X-rays. The prediction is performed every three months from the first visit, for a time lapse of one year and a half. An Independent Component Analysis (ICA) was computed to obtain Independent Components (ICs), which are used to describe the main directions of shape variations. A dataset of 3D shapes of 150 patients with MS was employed to extract the ICs, which were used to train our approach. Results: The approach generated an estimation of the shape of the spine through time. The estimated shape differs from the real curvature by 1.83, 5.18, and 4.79 degrees of Cobb angles in the proximal thoracic, main thoracic, and thoraco-lumbar lumbar sections, respectively. Conclusions: The results obtained from our approach indicate that predictions based on ICs are very promising. ICA offers the means to identify the variation in the 3D space of the evolution of the shape of the spine. Another advantage of using ICs is that they can be visualized for interpretation."

An alternative to these methods is the use of an Ultrasound (US) imaging system for the implementation of a more cost eficient intraoperative registration solution. In order to develop the registration solution with the US imaging system, the bone surface is segmented in both preoperative and intraoperative images, and the registration is done using the acquired surface. In this paper, we present the a preliminary results of a new approach to segment the bone surface from ultrasound volumes acquired by freehand 3D tracking of an ultrasound probe.

Sludge sample was collected in a water drinking plant located northern Mexico City. The sample was dried and then physicochemical and microbiological analyses were carried out (metal content, main oxides content, mineralogical analysis, helminth eggs content, fecal coliforms). In accordance with its characterization, two main steps of the zeolites production process were performed: 1) alkaline fusion of alum sludge-NaOH mixture for increasing the dissolved precursor's content and 2) alkaline hydrothermal treatment. Spherical particles of zeolite X were identified by SEM and XRD respectively. The best synthesized zeolite showed a CEC=2.11 meq/g, value being similar to the data reported for clinoptilolite (the most commonly zeolite used for water treatment in the removal of heavy metals). Thus, the synthesized zeolite X in this work can be used for the same purpose. © 2012 Materials Research Society."

Agile Software Development (ASD) encourages the delivery of working software frequently; however, there are many factors that affect productivity in that context. The objective of this paper is to analyze the research works about productivity in ASD to identify: the factors that affect productivity, the most used research methods, the most studied productivity levels, the concepts related to productivity, the most studied agile methodologies, and the use of productivity metrics in ASD. To perform such analysis, we conducted a Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) in which we included 25 primary studies. As result of the SMS, we identified the main factors that affect productivity in ASD and the context in which the included primary studies were performed. We found that Case Study was the most used research method, and interviews and questionnaires are widely used as data collection methods. We found that most of the reported factors affecting productivity in ASD are related to agile teams, and although quality should be related to productivity, it was not considered in all studies. © 2017 IEEE."

Such analysis involves a 1-D Hermite transform of all local Radon projections, where localization is achieved by applying a Gaussian window to the image. Since Gaussian window is isotropic, the 1-D analysis can be based on the 2-D cartesian Hermite transform. For the case of oriented patterns such as edges and lines, the image is suitably described with a unique projection giving the maximum directional energy. We show that the inverse Radon transform is not required in the synthesis process, since only the information along one direction is preserved. A more specific representation is introduced in an edge model whose parameters are determined in terms of the hermitian coefficients up to second order. Experimental results are also included."

Here we use the Google Books N-grams dataset to analyze the temporal evolution of word usage in several languages. We apply measures proposed recently to study rank dynamics, such as the diversity of N-grams in a given rank, the probability that an N-gram changes rank between successive time intervals, the rank entropy, and the rank complexity. Using different methods, results show that there are generic properties for different languages at different scales, such as a core of words necessary to minimally understand a language. We also propose a null model to explore the relevance of linguistic structure across multiple scales, concluding that N-gram statistics cannot be reduced to word statistics.

We apply measures proposed recently to study rank dynamics, such as the diversity of N-grams in a given rank, the probability that an N-gram changes rank between successive time intervals, the rank entropy, and the rank complexity. Using different methods, results show that there are generic properties for different languages at different scales, such as a core of words necessary to minimally understand a language. We also propose a null model to explore the relevance of linguistic structure across multiple scales, concluding that N-gram statistics cannot be reduced to word statistics.

This discrete model is suitable for representing disordered media such as rocks. Thus, motivated by its advantages to deal with discontinuous realistic media, in comparison to the continuum theory, we performed simulations of elastic wave propagation by using a vector percolating network that includes central and bond-bending force constants allowing local microscopic variation of the Poisson's ratio. The validity of the proposed approach is tested by comparing our numerical results with those from Garvin's exact analytical solution for a buried dilatational line source in a half space. In the free-surface response the Rayleigh waves play a prominent role."

Multi-agent architectures distribute the control among two or more agents, which will be in charge of different events. In this paper the design of a parallel Multi-agent architecture for genetic algorithms is described, using a bottom-up behavior design and reactive agents. Such design tries to achieve the improvement solution of parallel genetic algorithms. The purpose of incorporating a reactive behavior in the parallel genetic algorithms is to improve the overall performance by up-dating the sub-populations according to the general behavior of the algorithm avoiding getting stuck in local minima. Two kinds of experiments were conducted for each one of the algorithms and the results obtained with both experiments are shown."

This abstraction consists of arrays of n single-writer/multi-reader atomic registers, where n is the number of processes. These registers enable Byzantine tolerance by recording the whole history of values written to each one of them. A distributed algorithm building such a shared memory abstraction is first presented. This algorithm assumes t < n/3, which is shown to be a necessary and sufficient condition for such a construction. Hence, the algorithm is resilient-optimal. Then the paper presents distributed objects built on top of this read/write shared memory abstraction, which cope with Byzantine processes. As illustrated by these objects, the proposed shared memory abstraction is motivated by the fact that, for a lot of problems, algorithms are simpler to design and prove correct in a shared memory system than in a message-passing system.

How to bound the effects of a fault and how to tackle them in a dynamic system is still an open field. Here, an approach to studying this problem is presented as a hybrid strategy. The use of a multi-model technique from the point of view of real-time systems and intelligent control structure is described, in order to accomplish one challenge: to overcome the problem of the presence of local faults and the respective time delays within a real-time distributed system. This approach is pursued as a reconfigurable strategy according to communication time delays within a real-time distributed system. In fact, it is pursued as a reconfigurable strategy according to communication delays and local faults where the control strategy is modified from several perspectives. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presents a strategy for the reconfiguration of fault tolerant control through codesign with the scheduling of tasks and the reconfiguration of fuzzy Takagi-Sugeno (TKS) control for NCSs.

The architecture emulates a multiple modular computer, including both physical and virtual spares, with a small amount of physical processors (flight computer) and virtual redundancies (payload processors). The flight computer contains a main processor, as well as a backup and a redundant processor. However, the instrumentation for the Satex mission also includes a redundant LAN with autonomous capabilities to detect its failures, to reconfigure by itself and to provide on-line maintenance by automated means. Communications between flight computer and payload microcomputers are accomplished over this LAN, allowing a versatile operating behavior in terms of data communication as well as in terms of distributed fault tolerance. Under this scenario a semi-virtual expanded flight architecture is periodically implemented in the microsatellite in order to emulate a bigger and safer computer with increased fault-tolerant features. Previous topology is conformed periodically aiming at failure detection, fault isolation, and hardware reconfiguration of processors to obtain high availability; moreover, the architecture can be applied in any small space vehicle. The paper also concerns with fault containment regions, Byzantine majority voting mechanisms, reconfiguration procedures, hardware protections, hardware and software diversity and flight computer interface with satellite instrumentation."

To give these abilities to a manufacture cell formed of three industrial robots and two conveyors, a middleware based on the programming standard Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORA) was developed, thus creating a distributed manufacture cell, allowing us to have a real production with different final products. In order to optimize the production times of the different products to be manufactured, a product scheduler was developed using the algorithm Earlies Deadline First (EDF) and the support algorithm Deferrable Server (DS). Given that failures may occur on any of the specialized modules of the manufacture system, the self reconfiguration of the manufacture system is something very desirable. This article propose an algorithm to solve this problem, the algorithm identifies the failures in relation to the time it takes the system to make a product, then makes a modification on the working speed of the plant elements of the specialized modules."

The mass balance equation for a pollutant is used to analyze the existence of solutions. Through the adjoint functions and the duality principle for the anomaly of the punctual concentration, it is shown that the inverse problem is always unstable when the dispersion model has an associated adjoint model whose solution is of class C1.

Pond wastewater is usually discharged without treatment, and tidal conditions are not taken into account in the management plans. However, natural variability of nutrients makes difficult field evaluation and attribution of impacts. Here we implemented a three-dimensional coupled hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model (spatial resolution = 50 m × 50 m, time resolution = 4 s) in order to evaluate the dispersion conditions under specific tidal conditions of nutrient discharges from a semi-intensive shrimp farm during spring and neap tide. Ammonia was quickly assimilated by plankton and its concentration recovered initial levels 10 days after the beginning of the harvest. Due to the higher salinity of the pond effluents, shrimp farm discharges accumulate in waters and sediments of the upper lagoon creeks, mostly affecting the benthos, thus implying a potential risk of shrimp farm self-contamination. Maximum concentrations of most biogeochemical tracers occurred when the harvest ends and the ponds are fully emptied. We show that maximum nutrient concentrations can be reduced by ~ 10% when the harvest ends during spring tides compared to harvests ending during neap tides. This work may be useful to improve the management of shrimp farm effluents by reducing, easily and at little cost, nutrient impacts on tropical and sub-tropical receiving ecosystems."

In contrast to preceding works in this area that focused on enhancements of a particular access protocol, or on a mechanism that switches between different access protocols, this paper proposes a single access protocol capable of behaving simultaneously as a pure contention-based (e.g., CSMA) and as a round-robin-based protocol depending on traffic conditions. The main building block of the proposed protocol is the region, a cluster of nodes that establishes orderly access to the channel. Once a member of a region gains channel access through a contention-based protocol, it allows contention-free transmission to all other members of the region in a round-robin manner. The functionality of the protocol for UDP and TCP traffic is discussed. Simulation results show that RegionDCF outperforms standard CSMA-based IEEE 802.11 Distributed Coordination Function in many aspects, including higher throughput and channel efficiency."

The major conceptual change since 3 years ago is an expanded biological context so that transcriptional regulation is now part of a unit that initiates with the signal and continues with the signal transduction to the core of regulation, modifying expression of the affected target genes responsible for the response. We call these genetic sensory response units, or Gensor Units. We have initiated their high-level curation, with graphic maps and superreactions with links to other databases. Additional connectivity uses expandable submaps. RegulonDB has summaries for every transcription factor (TF) and TF-binding sites with internal symmetry. Several DNA-binding motifs and their sizes have been redefined and relocated. In addition to data from the literature, we have incorporated our own information on transcription start sites (TSSs) and transcriptional units (TUs), obtained by using high-throughput whole-genome sequencing technologies.

Its electronic format enables researchers to compare their results with the legacy of previous knowledge and supports bioinformatics tools and model building. Here, we summarize our progress with RegulonDB since our last Nucleic Acids Research publication describing Regulon DB, in 2013. In addition to maintaining curation up-to-date, we report a collection of 232 interactions with small RNAs affecting 192 genes, and the complete repertoire of 189 Elementary Genetic Sensory-Response units (GENSOR units), integrating the signal, regulatory interactions, and metabolic pathways they govern. These additions represent major progress to a higher level of understanding of regulated processes. We have updated the computationally predicted transcription factors, which total 304 (184 with experimental evidence and 120 from computational predictions); we updated our position-weight matrices and have included tools for clustering them in evolutionary families.

This abstraction consists of arrays of n single-writer/multi-reader atomic registers, where n is the number of processes. Differently from usual atomic registers which record a single value, each of these atomic registers records the whole history of values written to it. A distributed algorithm building such a shared memory abstraction it first presented. This algorithm assumes t < n/3, which is shown to be a necessary and sufficient condition for such a construction. Hence, the algorithm is resilient-optimal. Then the paper presents distributed algorithms built on top of this shared memory abstraction, which cope with up to t Byzantine processes. The simplicity of these algorithms constitutes a strong motivation for such a shared memory abstraction in the presence of Byzantine processes.For a lot of problems, algorithms are more difficult to design and prove correct in a message-passing system than in a shared memory system. Using a protocol stacking methodology, the aim of the proposed abstraction is to allow an easier design (and proof) of distributed algorithms, when the underlying system is an asynchronous message-passing system prone to Byzantine failures."

Design/methodology/approach - Relating autopoiesis with Ashby's law of requisite variety, self-organization is put forward as a way in which systems can be designed to match the variety of their environment. Findings - Guided self-organization has been shown to produce systems which can adapt to the requisite variety of their environment, offering more efficient solutions for problems that change in time than those obtained with traditional techniques. Originality/value - Being able to measure autopoiesis allows us to apply this measure to all systems. More living systems will be fitter to survive in their environments: biological, social, technological, or urban."

We use the local maxima over scales of the magnitude of the gradient and the maximum principal curvature as the two features used in a region growing procedure. In the first stage, the growth is constrained to regions of low gradient magnitude. In the final stage this constraint is relaxed to allow borders between regions to be defined.

Measurements are made from binary images obtained with a previously described segmentation process. The skeletons of the segmented trees are produced by thinning, ff branch and crossing points are identified and segments of the trees are labeled and stored as a chain code. The operator selects a tree to be measured and decides if it is an arterial or venous tree. An automatic process then measures the lengths, areas and angles of the individual segments of the tree. Geometrical data and the connectivity information between branches from continuous retinal vessel trees are tabulated. A number of geometrical properties and topological indexes are derived. Vessel diameters and branching angles are validated against manual measurements and several derived geometrical and topological properties are extracted from red-free fundus images of ten normotensive and ten age- and sex-matched hypertensive subjects and compared with previously reported results."

Two experiments were performed with the proposed system: the first one under three patients with lower limb prostheses in order to apply the tracking algorithm. The second was carried out in three healthy control subjects with the purpose of validating the proposed algorithm and comparing the results with a motion capture system (MoCap). In this test the participants carried out two different activities; the results present errors from 3.3 to 4.9 mm according to the root mean square error. This suggests that the system can be used to track human joints under different conditions; however, it is necessary to solve the problem of occlusion artifacts by using human body models or by employing several depth cameras."

In this paper we illustrate the benefits of a data mining inspired approach to statistically analysing a bespoke data set, the academic multicentre randomised control trial, UK Glucose Insulin in Stroke Trial (GIST-UK), with a view to discovering new insights distinct from the original hypotheses of the trial. We consider post-stroke mortality prediction as a function of days since stroke onset, showing that the time scales that best characterise changes in mortality risk are most naturally defined by examination of the mortality curve. We show that certain risk factors differentiate between very short term and intermediate term mortality. In particular, we show that age is highly relevant for intermediate term risk but not for very short or short term mortality. We suggest that this is due to the concept of frailty. Other risk factors are highlighted across a range of variable types including socio-demographics, past medical histories and admission medication. Using the most statistically significant risk factors we build predictive classification models for very short term and short/intermediate term mortality.

Such a methodology will try to emulate the human action of human vision in a general-conceptual way the manufacturing workers performs their assembly, sorting or part moving actions within a manufacturing production line. Generalconceptual actions of workers includes: primary recognition of objects and working area, training and skill mastering of procedures and tool management. The acquisition of assembly skills by manufacturing robots today , is greatly supported by the efective use of contact force sensing and object recognition vision system, but the performance of industrial robots working in unstructured environments can be improved using such a methodologyf including visual perception and learning techniques. In this sense, the described object recognition technique in this paper, is accomplished using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) architecture which receives a descriptive vector called CFD&POSE as the input. This vector represents an innovative methodology for classification and identification of pieces in robotic tasks. The vector compresses 3D object data from assembly parts and it is invariant to scale, rotation and orientation, and it also supports a wide range of illumination levels. The CFD&POSE approach [7] in combination with the fast learning capability of ART networks has been tested and implemented to come as a generalconceptual method for artificial vision which indicates the suitability for industrial robot vision manufacturing tasks applications, this methodology which integrates Acquisition, data Compression, data Storing and object Reconstruction potentials, has been calledACSR-Vision Module by the authors, in this paper, an integrated module like this is showed and its potential use in manufacturing applications is demonstrated through experimental results. © 2007 IEEE."

The objects are represented by collections of interest points which are described in a multi-resolution framework, giving a representation of those points at different scales. Inspired by [1], a stack of descriptors is built only the first time that the interest points are detected and extracted from the region of interest. This provides efficiency of representation and results in faster tracking due to the fact that it can be done off-line. An Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) using a constant velocity model estimates the position and the scale of the object, with the uncertainty in the position and the scale obtained by the UKF, the search of the object can be constrained only in a specific region in both the image and in scale. The use of this approach shows an improvement in real-time tracking and in the ability to recover from full occlusions."

Due to the different nature of common signal processing and geometrical attacks, two different techniques for embed a same watermark are used in this method. In the first one, the luminance component (Y) information is used to embed the watermark bit sequence into the magnitude of the middle frequencies of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). In the second one, a selected region of 2D histogram composed by blue-difference and red-difference (Cb-Cr) chrominance components is modified according to the watermark bit sequence. The quality of the watermarked image is measured using the following well-known indices peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), visual information fidelity (VIF) and structural similarity index (SSIM). The difference color of the watermarked image is obtained using the normalized color difference (NCD) measure. The experimental results show that the proposed method provides robustness against several geometric distortions, signal processing operations, combined distortions and photo editing.

In particular Diffusion-Weighted MRI (DWI) is highly sensitive in detecting early cerebral ischemic changes in acute stroke. Cerebral infarction lesion segmentation from DWI is accomplished in this work by applying nonparametric density estimation. The quality of the class boundaries is improved by including an edge confidence map, that is the confidence of truly being in the presence of a border between adjacent regions. The adjacency graph, that is constructed with the label regions, is analyzed and pruned to merge adjacent regions. The method was applied to real images, keeping all parameters constant throughout the process for each data set. The combination of region segmentation and edge detection proved to be a robust automatic technique of segmentation from DWI images of cerebral infarction regions in acute ischemic stroke. In a comparison with the reference infarct lesions segmentation, the automatic segmentation presented a significant correlation (r = 0.935), and an average Tanimoto index of 0.538."

To recognize the selected object region after geometric distortions, during the embedding process the SURF features are estimated and stored in advance to be used during the detection process. In the detection stage, the SURF features of the distorted image are estimated and matched with the stored ones. From the matching result, SURF features are used to compute the Affine-transformation parameters and the object region is recovered. The quality of the watermarked image is measured using the Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) and the Visual Information Fidelity (VIF). The experimental results show the proposed method provides robustness against several geometric distortions, signal processing operations and combined distortions. The receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves also show the desirable detection performance of the proposed method.

We analyzed the root tropic responses of thioredoxin (trxs), thigmotropic (wav2-1), and hydrotropic (ahr1 and nhr1) Arabidopsis thaliana mutants treated with low concentrations of paraquat (PQ), which induces mild oxidative stress, and established a new method for evaluating root waviness (root bending effort, RBE). This method estimates root bending by measuring and summing local curvature over the whole length of the root, regardless of the asymmetry of the wavy pattern under thigmostimulation. In roots of the wav2-1 mutant, but not in those of the trxs and ahr1 mutants, RBE was significantly inhibited under mild oxidative stress. Thigmotropic stimulation of wav2-1 mutant roots, with or without PQ treatment, showed high levels of reactive oxygen species fluorescence, in contrast to roots of the ahr1 mutant. Furthermore, PQ inhibited root growth in all genotypes tested, except in the wav2-1 mutant. In a hydrotropism assay of the trxs and wav2-1 mutants, root growth behavior was similar to the wild type with and without PQ, while the root growth of ahr1 and nhr1 mutants was diminished with PQ. These results indicate that hydrotropic and thigmotropic mutants respond differently to exogenous PQ, depending on the tropic stimulus perceived. Therefore, the mechanisms underlying hydrotropism and thigmotropism may differ. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

This feature allows identification of variable-shaped metaphases and interphase nuclei in the presence of many artefacts (one metaphase per hundreds of nuclei and thousands of artefacts). The texture of the cytological objects (seen as rough surfaces) is quantified by scanning, in one dimension, the lines contained in a closed contour. MDWRE proves to be suitable for image magnifications by a factor of as low as ten, making faster scanning of slides possible. The use of this feature gives +14%, +65%, +133% and +133% better performance figures than classical textural features derived from co-occurrence matrices, such as contrast, energy, entropy and angular second moment, respectively, and +51% better than the relative extrema density (RED). The MDWRE per object and the shape of the histogram of the depth-width ratio of grey-level roughs have been shown to be very useful as textural features for the classification of metaphase images.As a step towards automation of mitotic index estimation for cell proliferation studies, a roughness feature of surface-intensity images is introduced: the mean depth-width ratio of extrema (MDWRE).

Motivated by the necessity for establishing communication in wireless ad hoc networks in which the only information available to a vertex is its immediate neighborhood, we are considering routing algorithms that use the neighborhood information of a vertex for routing with constant memory only. We solve the problem for three types of directed planar geometric networks: Eulerian (in which every vertex has the same number of incoming and outgoing edges), Outerplanar (in which a single face contains all vertices of the network), and Strongly Face Connected, a new class of geometric networks that we define in the article, consisting of several faces, each face being a strongly connected outerplanar graph. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

First, we analyze a 3-node route, where only the intermediate node is in movement while source and destination nodes remain static. From this case, we show how route duration is affected by the initial position of the intermediate node and the size of the region where it is located. We also consider a second case where all nodes of 3-node routes are mobile. Based on extensive analysis of these routes, we determine the PDF of route duration under two different mobility models. This PDF can be determined by either analytical or statistical methods. The main contribution of this paper is that the time duration of a route formed by N intermediate nodes can be accurately computed by considering the minimum route duration of a set of N routes of 3 nodes each. Simulation work was conducted using the NS-2 network simulator to verify the accuracy of the proposed model and to compare it with other proposals found in the literature. We show that our model is in better agreement with simulation results as compared with other models."

Even if the tasks are executed in less time than their WCETs, there is no possibility of rearranging the rest of the tasks to use the idle slots made available during execution. Therefore, the resulting problem consists of proposing a strategy to exploit the idle intervals. The difficulty of this problem increases when considering that the tasks that are accommodated first have stochastic execution times and that aperiodic tasks used to occupy the idle slots are composed of jobs that have precedence constraints. Besides, these jobs have stochastic temporal restrictions that must be met. To address this issue, a novel heuristic method based on Bayes networks is proposed. Two main contributions are presented. First is the mapping of the problem into a Bayesian network, and second is a heuristic that helps identify the best job, from the new set of aperiodic tasks, for occupying an idle slot created by RUN during its execution. There are two main goals in this work: to reduce global idle time and to execute any reliable job-shop by its deadline. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

The collaboration is needed to ensure the expected results. The organizations not only face all the challenges identified in distributed environments, such as communication, coordination, knowledge transfer, teamwork, etc. Also, concerns arise regarding the efficiency and exposure of organizational processes and uncertainty about the specific responsibilities of each organization to achieve the expected result of the collaboration, especially when they have not previously collaborated. This paper presents a set of activities executed by three software organizations to prepare a software construction phase, called Run-Through Practice (RTP). The organizations agreed to execute it because they have seen in the need of working together to construct components and to integrate them into a large-scale software product, since they had not worked together before. During the RTP, the organizations established their collaborative relationship through agreements and communication, coordination and cooperation activities. Among the results, the organizations discovered the activities and mechanisms to be performed in the software construction phase, allowing to systematize their activities and face technical challenges and issues."
18000,Runoff and nutrient loss from a water repellent soil,2018,Alfonso Gastélum Strozzi,Instituto de Ciencias Aplicadas y Tecnología (ICAT),,,,10.1016/j.geoderma.2018.02.019,https://www-sciencedirect-com.pbidi.unam.mx:2443/science/article/pii/S0016706117314465?via%3Dihub,TC,Environmental Science,Phosphorus;Soil water repellency;Hydrophobicity;Infiltration;Runoff simulation,"The effects of soil water repellency (SWR) on runoff and nutrient losses are difficult to isolate. Hydrophobic organic substances coating soil particles can severely delay water infiltration and enhance runoff. We used a portable run-on simulator to investigate the effect of SWR on runoff and nutrient loss. Intact soil slabs, 0.48 m long and 0.19 m wide, were collected from a severely water-repellent Andosol under pasture. One day before simulating 60-min long run-on events with an intensity of 60 mm h−1, superphosphate was applied at a rate of 45 kg P ha−1. The effects of SWR were quantified by comparing runoff volumes and nutrient losses from run-on events conducted with water and a fully wetting aqueous ethanol solution as run-on liquids. Further, through conducting multiple consecutive water run-on events with the same soil slab, the hypothesis, that SWR is lost through the washing off of hydrophobic materials, was tested. Finally, runoff dynamics were visualised by adding a dye to the run-on water. In the first run-on experiment, 88% of the water applied was captured as runoff, while no runoff was observed when aqueous ethanol was used as run-on liquid, providing strong evidence that SWR governed runoff generation from this Andosol. In consecutive water run-on experiments, approximately 23% of the applied P was recovered in the runoff from the first event, while the cumulative P loss over ten consecutive run-on events was around 30% of the applied P. This confirms that nutrient losses were associated with SWR and the occurrence of runoff. After ten consecutive run-on events, the persistence of both actual and potential SWR in areas of the slab that had been wetted were significantly (p < 0.5) reduced. But the persistence of potential SWR of the soil was still classified as severe, suggesting only minor losses of hydrophobic materials from the soil surface. The persistence of potential SWR and the degree of SWR of the dry areas remained more or less unchanged. In accordance with this, visualisation of the wetted areas showed that runoff occurred as rivulets guided by surface topography, rather than as sheet flow, with the wetted area increasing from approximately 20% of the slab in the first event to around one third of the total slab area in the final event. This pattern is reflected in the cumulative pattern of the P losses over the ten events. Consequently, we conclude that SWR should be considered as a factor in hydrological modelling and should be included in models to address appropriately the risk of surface water contamination by solutes exogenously applied to water-repellent soils."

We present a methodology for rural road extraction from SPOT images. Our approach is centered in a fusion algorithm based on the Hermite transform that allows increasing the spatial resolution to 2.5 m. The Hermite transform is an image representation model that mimics some of the more important properties of human vision such as multiresolution and the Gaussian derivative model of early vision. Analyzing the directional energy of the expansion coefficients allows classifying the image according to the local pattern dimensionality; roads are associated to 1D patterns. © 2009 SPIE.

We describe scanning curves for the coverage of surfaces using a chain code. Thus, scanning curves are composed of constant straight-line segments using only orthogonal directions and are represented by means of the orthogonal direction change chain code, which can describe three-dimensional curves. Surfaces which are represented using the orthogonal direction change chain code are called discrete surfaces. The chain elements represent the orthogonal direction changes of the constant straight-line segments of the scanning curve for the coverage of a surface. There are only five possible orthogonal direction changes for representing any scanning curve. This chain code only considers relative direction changes, which allows us to have a unique surface descriptor invariant under translation and rotation. Also, this surface descriptor may be invariant under starting point and mirroring transformations. Finally, in order to demonstrate the use of our proposed method, we present some results using surfaces from digital elevation model data and digital images. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

To perform the analysis, we use a recursive T-matrix algorithm that we developed. We show how the aggregation phenomenon can tremendously decrease the local scattering properties of a white paint film and consequently affects its hiding power. We also compare the results with the equivalent spherical volume approximation which is used in particle size analysis using static or dynamic light-scattering methods. We show how the equivalent volume approximation used in those methods should be handled with care."

HDR-IVW-V employs scene detection to reduce both computational complexity and undesired visual attention to watermarked regions. Visual imperceptibility is achieved by finding the region of a frame with the highest hiding capacities on which the Human Visual System (HVS) cannot recognize the embedded watermark. The embedded watermark remains visually imperceptible as long as the normal color calibration parameters are held. HDR-IVW-V is evaluated on PQ-encoded HDR video content successfully attaining visual imperceptibility, robustness to tone mapping operations and image quality preservation."

Scheduling is critical as it impacts the system performance due to limited computing resources. This work presents a linear time invariant model based on the frequency transition of nodes in distributed system. In this model a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller is designed to schedule the transmission frequency of nodes. The controller assigns the transmission frequency into a region with minimum and maximum bounds intended to satisfy the network's utility. A 2DOF helicopter simulation shows the effectiveness of this scheduling strategy.

IoT networks have evolved around the wireless sensor network (WSN), and the following research looks at relevant IoT concepts and the different security issues that occur specifically at the network layer. This analysis is performed using a structured literature review (SLR). This form of bibliographic review has been a trend in recent years. Its strength is the performance of a bibliometric analysis that allows studying both trends in the line of research that you want to address and the relevant authors. This SLR reviews 53 proposals between 2011 and 2020, whose contribution is to mitigate attacks in the RPL (Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks) protocol. The revised proposals emerged after selecting keywords and databases in which to apply the search. Initially, approximately 380 research works appeared, for which it was necessary to continue using filters to refine the proposals to be included. After reading titles and abstracts, 53 papers were finally selected. In addition to analyzing the attacks mitigated in the RPL protocol, it is intended to identify the trend by which these attacks are reduced, as a result of the review, nine attacks have been found: rank, blackhole, selective forwarding, wormhole, DODAG (Destination-Oriented Directed Acyclic Graph) version number, DAO (Destination Advertisement Object) inconsistency, DIO (DODAG Information Object) suppression, Sybil, and sinkhole. Each of the 53 proposals analyzed in this review has an associated mitigation strategy, these strategies have been categorized into four groups, based on authentication or cryptography, based on network monitoring, based on secure parent node selection and other. According to the results, the authors' primary mitigation strategy is based on network monitoring, with 30%. This review also identifies the principal authors and countries that need the development of this line of research."

In this work a novel framework that combines two methods to isolate and display functional characteristics of the heart using sequences of cardiac computed tomography (CT) is proposed. A shape extraction method, which includes a new segmentation correction scheme, is performed jointly with a motion estimation approach.Methods: For the segmentation task we built a Spatiotemporal Point Distribution Model (STPDM) that encodes spatial and temporal variability of the heart structures. Intensity and gradient information guide the STPDM. We present a novel method to correct segmentation errors obtained with the STPDM. It consists of a deformable scheme that combines three types of image features: local histograms, gradients and binary patterns. A bio-inspired image representation model based on the Hermite transform is used for motion estimation. The segmentation allows isolating the structure of interest while the motion estimation can be used to characterize the movement of the complete heart muscle.Results: The work is evaluated with several sequences of cardiac CT. The left ventricle was used for evaluation. Several metrics were used to validate the proposed framework. The efficiency of our method is also demonstrated by comparing with other techniques.Conclusion: The implemented tool can enable physicians to better identify mechanical problems. The new correction scheme substantially improves the segmentation performance.

Thus, the measurement of changes in morphology of arterioles and venules can be of diagnostic value. Here we present a method to automatically segment retinal blood vessels based upon multiscale feature extraction. This method overcomes the problem of variations in contrast inherent in these images by using the first and second spatial derivatives of the intensity image that gives information about vessel topology. This approach also enables the detection of blood vessels of different widths, lengths and orientations. The local maxima over scales of the magnitude of the gradient and the maximum principal curvature of the Hessian tensor are used in a multiple pass region growing procedure. The growth progressively segments the blood vessels using feature information together with spatial information. The algorithm is tested on red-free and fluorescein retinal images, taken from two local and two public databases. Comparison with first public database yields values of 75.05% true positive rate (TPR) and 4.38% false positive rate (FPR). Second database values are of 72.46% TPR and 3.45% FPR. Our results on both public databases were comparable in performance with other authors. However, we conclude that these values are not sensitive enough so as to evaluate the performance of vessel geometry detection. Therefore we propose a new approach that uses measurements of vessel diameters and branching angles as a validation criterion to compare our segmented images with those hand segmented from public databases. Comparisons made between both hand segmented images from public databases showed a large inter-subject variability on geometric values. A last evaluation was made comparing vessel geometric values obtained from our segmented images between red-free and fluorescein paired images with the latter as the “ground truth”. Our results demonstrated that borders found by our method are less biased and follow more consistently the border of the vessel and therefore they yield more confident geometric values."

Under those conditions, separating the meaningful regions of the reconstructed density function is not trivial. Despite development efforts that specifically target electron tomography manual segmentation continues to be the preferred method. Based on previous good experiences using a segmentation based on fuzzy logic principles (fuzzy segmentation) where the reconstructed density functions also have low signal-to-noise ratio, we applied it to electron tomographic reconstructions. We demonstrate the usefulness of the fuzzy segmentation algorithm evaluating it within the limits of segmenting electron tomograms of selectively stained, plastic embedded spiny dendrites. The results produced by the fuzzy segmentation algorithm within the framework presented are encouraging. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

Then, we compute a statistical model of the contour of interest from a set of training images. Thereby, our Hierarchical Active Shape Model (HASM) captures a large range of shape variability even from a small group of training samples, improving segmentation accuracy.

The maximum a posteriori criterion (MAP) is used for the optimization of the solution, and performed with a deterministic method: Iterated Conditional Modes (ICM).

Then, we apply a time-frequency analysis to the signal by means of the Smoothed Pseudo Wigner-Ville Distribution (SPWVD) in order to obtain instantaneous frequency (IF) information. Based on the time-frequency behavior, we estimate a pattern to characterize the seismic signal. At the same time, we analyze the energy signal envelope, which is the derivative of the filtered cumulative energy. With the energy behavior, we estimate the different transitions along the seismic signal. The main objective of this work is the characterization of seismic signals, and their detection above a specific level of energy, so that, we can eventually build a seismic alarm."

This analysis allows to diagnose, identify and classify different diseases. This is a computationally challenging task due to the large number of genes and a relatively small number of samples. Some papers applied the generalized neuron (GN) to solve approximation functions, to calculate density estimates, prediction and classification problems [1, 2]. In this work we show how a GN can be used in the task of microarray classification. The proposed methodology is as follows: first reducing the dimensionality of the genes using a genetic algorithm, then the generalized neuron is trained using one bioinspired algorithms: Particle Swarm Optimization, Genetic Algorithm and Differential Evolution. Finally the precision of the methodology it is tested by classifying three databases of DNA microarrays:   Leukemia benchmarck    ALL−AML ,   Colon Tumor  and   Prostate cancer ."

It has been demonstrated that combining states randomization and Hebbian learning enlarges the basin of attraction of globally optimal attractors. The procedure is called self-modeling and it has been applied in symmetric Hopfield networks with discrete states and without self-recurrent connections. We are interested in knowing which topological constraints can be relaxed. So, the self-modeling process is tested in asymmetric Hopfield networks with continuous states and self-recurrent connections. The best results are obtained in networks with modular structure."

This process of structural self-optimization has so far only been demonstrated on relatively small artificial neural networks with random or highly regular and constrained topologies, and it remains an open question to what extent it can be generalized to more biologically realistic topologies. In this work, we therefore test this process by running it on the connectome of the widely studied nematode worm, C. elegans, the only living being whose neural system has been mapped in its entirety. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that the self-optimization process can be generalized to bigger and biologically plausible networks. We conclude by speculating that the reset-convergence mechanism could find a biological equivalent in the sleep-wake cycle in C. elegans."

Processes of this kind characterize both living and artificial systems, making self-organization a concept that is at the basis of several disciplines, from physics to biology and engineering. Placed at the frontiers between disciplines, artificial life (ALife) has heavily borrowed concepts and tools from the study of self-organization, providing mechanistic interpretations of lifelike phenomena as well as useful constructivist approaches to artificial system design. Despite its broad usage within ALife, the concept of self-organization has been often excessively stretched or misinterpreted, calling for a clarification that could help with tracing the borders between what can and cannot be considered self-organization. In this review, we discuss the fundamental aspects of self-organization and list the main usages within three primary ALife domains, namely “soft” (mathematical/computational modeling), “hard” (physical robots), and “wet” (chemical/biological systems) ALife. We also provide a classification to locate this research. Finally, we discuss the usefulness of self-organization and related concepts within ALife studies, point to perspectives and challenges for future research, and list open questions. We hope that this work will motivate discussions related to self-organization in ALife and related fields."

We implemented two fundamental self-organized algorithms: one with constant direction and one with constant velocity preference to reach a desired target. We performed evolutionary optimization on both algorithms in five basic traffic scenarios and tested the optimized algorithms under different vehicle densities. We provide optimal algorithm and parameter selection criteria and compare the maximal flux and collision risk of each solution and situation. We found that i) different scenarios and densities require different algorithmic approaches, i.e., UAVs have to behave differently in sparse and dense environments or when they have common or different targets; ii) a slower-is-faster effect is implicitly present in our models, i.e., the maximal flux is achieved at densities where the average speed is far from maximal; iii) communication delay is the most severe destabilizing environmental condition that has a fundamental effect on performance and needs to be taken into account when designing algorithms to be used in real life."

Basically, a complex network that can form an associative memory of the state configurations of the attractors on which it converges will optimize its structure: it will spontaneously generalize over these typically suboptimal attractors and thereby also reinforce more optimal attractors-even if these better solutions are normally so hard to find that they have never been previously visited. Ideally, after sufficient self-optimization the most optimal attractor dominates the state space, and the network will converge on it from any initial condition. This technique has been applied to social networks, gene regulatory networks, and neural networks, but its application to less restricted neural controllers, as typically used in evolutionary robotics, has not yet been attempted. Here we show for the first time that the self-optimization process can be implemented in a continuous-time recurrent neural network with asymmetrical connections. We discuss several open challenges that must still be addressed before this technique could be applied in actual robotic scenarios."

Current theory assumes that passengers are served optimally when vehicles arrive at stations with regular intervals. In this paper, it is shown that self-organization can improve the performance of public transportation systems beyond the theoretical optimum by responding adaptively to local conditions. This is possible because of a slower-is-faster effect, where passengers wait more time at stations but total travel times are reduced. The proposed self-organizing method uses antipheromones to regulate headways, which are inspired by the stigmergy (communication via environment) of some ant colonies."

First, in the natural-language interpretation process, the system generates two outputs: (1) conceptual dependence, expressing the linguistic meaning of the statement, and (2) verbal confirmation, a paraphrase in natural language that is repeated to the user to confirm that the command has been correctly understood. Then, a conceptual-dependency interpreter extracts semantic role structures from the input sentence and looks for such structures in a set of known interpretation patterns. We evaluate this approach in a series of skill-specific semantic-reasoning experiments. Finally, we demonstrate our system in the general-purpose service robot test of the RoboCup-at-Home international competition, where incomplete information is given to a robot and the robot must recognize and request the missing information, and we compare our results with a series of baselines from the competition where our proposal performed best."

Despite its importance, this process requires a lot of user intervention by either purely manual or semi-automatic processing (with the aid of graphical interfaces). Since reconstructing a 3D model of these macromolecules at nano-scale resolution requires thousands of particles, the particle selection phase is bound to become a serious bottleneck in the reconstruction process. In this article we propose a semi-automatic procedure for selecting particles from a micrograph that aims to reduce the false positive rate. We achieve this by first using a fuzzy-sets-based segmentation method, that requires very little user intervention, to detect the background, and then calculating a cross-correlation measure only on points with low affinity to the micrograph's background."

Algorithm of delayed relay control gain adaptation for semiglobal stabilization is suggested using delayed information about amplitude of oscillations. Proposed algorithm rejects bounded uncertainties in the time delay: once being designed for the upper bound of uncertainty in the time delay for given system this relay delayed control law ensure semiglobal stabilization for any values of the time delay less than the upper bound even in the case when the delay is variable.

This makes the emerging second-person approach to social cognition a more promising framework for studying ASD than classical approaches focusing on mindreading capacities in detached, observer-based arrangements. According to the second-person approach, embodied, perceptual, and embedded or interactive capabilities are also required for understanding others, and these are hypothesized to be compromised in ASD. We therefore recorded the dynamics of real-time sensorimotor interaction in pairs of control participants and participants with High-Functioning Autism (HFA), using the minimalistic human-computer interface paradigm known as perceptual crossing (PC). We investigated whether HFA is associated with impaired detection of social contingency, i.e., a reduced sensitivity to the other's responsiveness to one's own behavior. Surprisingly, our analysis reveals that, at least under the conditions of this highly simplified, computer-mediated, embodied form of social interaction, people with HFA perform equally well as controls. This finding supports the increasing use of virtual reality interfaces for helping people with ASD to better compensate for their social disabilities. Further dynamical analyses are necessary for a better understanding of the mechanisms that are leading to the somewhat surprising results here obtained."

To pursuit this goal a group of Kalman Filters is proposed, one per sensor in order to estimate a state of the plant per sensor. Thereafter, a self-organized map processes the information in order to determine the response areas within the map. Moreover, Kalman filter auto tuning procedure, becomes an interesting issue due to correlated noise amongst them as well as local state dependency at this point this may call a pre-processing stage. Furthermore, once global state vector is produced, the classification stage takes place as long as this vector exists as post processing stage. The resulting maps determine areas of fault free scenarios or nonlinear and no healthy responses classified as faults. This last point is obtained through a high accuracy of the system. © 2003-2012 Latin American Applied Research Journal."

This paper answers the question in the affirmative, by proving that there are objects with lock-free implementations, but without wait-free implementations—using objects of any finite power. We precisely define an object called n-process long-lived approximate agreement (n-LLAA), in which two sets of processes associated with two sides, 0 or 1, need to decide on a sequence of increasingly closer outputs. We prove that 2-LLAA has a lock-free implementation using reads and writes only, while n-LLAA has a lock-free implementation using reads, writes and (n − 1)-process consensus objects. In contrast, we prove that there is no wait-free implementation of the n-LLAA object using reads, writes and specific (n − 1)-process consensus objects, called (n − 1)-window registers."

In the second process a Point Distribution Model (PDM), previously trained, is used for the segmentation of the desired object. The filtering process is then employed before the segmentation stage with the aim of improving the results. The obtained result in the filtering process is used as a way to make more robust the segmentation stage. We evaluate the proposed method in the segmentation of the left ventricle of fetal ultrasound data. Different metrics are used to validate and compare the performance with other methods applied to fetal echocardiographic images. © 2016 SPIE."

The method is based on an active shape model which includes profiles of Hermite features. In order to fit the shape model we used a PCA of Hermite features. This model was tested on ultrasound images of the fetal brain taken from 20 pregnant women with gestational weeks varying from 18 to 24. Segmentation results compared to manual annotation show a mean Hausdorff distance of 6.85 mm using a conventional active shape model trained with gray profiles, and a mean Hausdorff distance of 5.67 mm using Hermite profiles.

The main part of this difficulty is related to the setting of the linear photoacoustic transport model. Notably errors are due to the discrepancy between the mathematical reconstruction and the physical realization: Tomographic image reconstruction from projections require a linear acquisition system. However in practice, the physical reality presents different non-linear phenomena. In account of this incompatibility, it was our purpose to provide some advancement in signal processing for dealing the projection issue while considering different perspectives in the interpretation of the transport model to be applied in a broader manner. Numerical examples are analyzed in detail and unveil the foundations for photoacoustic signal processing methodologies focused on the task of tomographic image reconstruction from projections."

Of particular interest to safety-critical systems is utilisation of the local intelligence to provide health monitoring, fault detection and fault tolerance. However, crucial to system safety is the ability to predict time delays in the system and analyse their effect on control system performance. For real-time systems the delays associated with communicating diagnostic messages may result in safety deadlines being missed. At present, smart components are integrated in an ad-hoc way.

Mexicós City population was divided in three different groups: • all children aged 4-12 years; • persons aged 2-64 with underlying chronic medical conditions; • adults aged 65 years and older; The simulation model is based in the vaccines distribution to this three groups in a differential way, exploring which proportion would show the shortest epidemic duration, therefore being that one the more efficient distribution strategy. The results obtained through the simulation, would help to minimize epidemic damage as in 2009 with the A(H1N1) strain. Also any other influenza strain should be considered in order to develop a containment strategy. To set up the simulation model a homogeneous social contact network was considered, where every population group presents its own social behavior forming small clusters and also presenting a probability of being in contact with an agent of a different cluster, as happens in social groups. Based on Mexico's city population, estimations show that the 28% presents underlying chronic medical conditions, health care institutions consider only the most acute disease such as diabetes mellitus, heart problems and some kinds of cancer. The population group aged between 4-12 years represents approximately also the 28% of the entire population, while adults aged 65 years and older represents hardly a 6.6%. These three considered groups represents the more vulnerable population to be infected by a respiratory transmission disease during an epidemic threshold situation. The agent based simulation was set up in the NetLogo software and was run under a full randomized factorial experiments design, results were analyzed by an analysis of variance. Final results show that epidemic duration lasts less when the schoolchildren population received the biggest proportion of vaccination rather than giving priority to persons with underlying chronic medical conditions as done now by the actual containment strategies. These results are consistent with the knowledge that an epidemic outbreak starts between the household population, and due to the higher social interactions that occur at schools, it is more probable that this population affects more in the epidemic propagation. The 2009 new AH1N1 influenza virus strain showed the weakness of the public health authorities in for planning a pandemic containment strategy. The outbreak of the new strain had expanded rapidly around the world by the current connectivity conditions. An optimal strategy was needed to design an adequate containment policy at the proper outbreaks moment. The most common ways to control an outbreak are vaccination and isolation, the first one represents public investments in acquiring enough amounts of doses, the decision of social isolation involves less expenses as much as promoting, but imply stopping many productive activities. One of the more affected sectors, as an example, would the touristic sector, which in Mexico has represented the third economical income in the past years (Mexicós National Institute for Statistics Geography and Information, INEGI 2014 report). This means that before such a critical arrangement could be implemented, other containment strategies should be carry out. While influenza vaccine is the most effective tool for preventing."

To set up the simulation model a homogeneous social contact network was considered, where every population group presents its own social behavior forming small clusters and also presenting a probability of being in contact with an agent of a different cluster, as happens in social groups. Based on Mexico's city population, estimations show that the 28% presents underlying chronic medical conditions, health care institutions consider only the most acute disease such as diabetes mellitus, heart problems and some kinds of cancer. The population group aged between 4-12 years represents approximately also the 28% of the entire population, while adults aged 65 years and older represents hardly a 6.6%. These three considered groups represents the more vulnerable population to be infected by a respiratory transmission disease during an epidemic threshold situation. The agent based simulation was set up in the NetLogo software and was run under a full randomized factorial experiments design, results were analyzed by an analysis of variance. Final results show that epidemic duration lasts less when the schoolchildren population received the biggest proportion of vaccination rather than giving priority to persons with underlying chronic medical conditions as done now by the actual containment strategies. These results are consistent with the knowledge that an epidemic outbreak starts between the household population, and due to the higher social interactions that occur at schools, it is more probable that this population affects more in the epidemic propagation. The 2009 new AH1N1 influenza virus strain showed the weakness of the public health authorities in for planning a pandemic containment strategy. The outbreak of the new strain had expanded rapidly around the world by the current connectivity conditions. An optimal strategy was needed to design an adequate containment policy at the proper outbreaks moment. The most common ways to control an outbreak are vaccination and isolation, the first one represents public investments in acquiring enough amounts of doses, the decision of social isolation involves less expenses as much as promoting, but imply stopping many productive activities. One of the more affected sectors, as an example, would the touristic sector, which in Mexico has represented the third economical income in the past years (Mexicós National Institute for Statistics Geography and Information, INEGI 2014 report). This means that before such a critical arrangement could be implemented, other containment strategies should be carry out. While influenza vaccine is the most effective tool for preventing."
18305,Simultaneous consensus tasks: A tighter characterization of set-consensus,2006,Sergio Rajsbaum Gorodezky,Instituto de Matemáticas (IM),,9783540681397,,10.1007/11947950_36,http://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/tech-report/2006-reports/060025.pdf,TC,"Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing",,"We address the problem of solving a task T=(T 1,...T m ) (called (m,1)-BG), in which a processor returns in an arbitrary one of m simultaneous consensus subtasks T 1,...T m . Processor p i submits to T an input vector of proposals (prop i,1,...,prop i,m ), one entry per subtask, and outputs, from just one subtask ℓ, a pair (ℓ, prop j,l ) for some j. All processors that output at ℓ output the same proposal. Let d be a bound on the number of distinct input vectors that may be submitted to T. For example, d=3 if Democrats always vote Democrats across the board, and similarly for Republicans and Libertarians. A wait-free algorithm that immaterial of the number of processors solves T provided m ≥d is presented. In addition, if in each T j we allow k-set consensus rather than consensus, i.e., for each ℓ, the outputs satisfy |{j |  prop j , ℓ}| ≤k, then the same algorithm solves T if m ≥⌈d/k ⌉. What is the power of T=(T 1,...,T m ) when given as a subroutine, to be used by any number of processors with any number of input vectors? Obviously, T solves m-set consensus since each processor p i can submit the vector (id i ,id i ,...id i ), but can m-set consensus solve T? We show it does, and thus simultaneous consensus is a new characterization of set-consensus. Finally, what if each T j is just a binary-consensus rather than consensus? Then we get the novel problem that was recently introduced of the Committee-Decision. It was shown that for 3 processors and m=2, the simultaneous binary-consensus is equivalent to (3,2)-set consensus. Here, using a variation of our wait-free algorithms mentioned above, we show that a task, in which a processor is required to return in one of m simultaneous binary-consensus subtasks, when used by n processors, is equivalent to (n,m)-set consensus. Thus, while set-consensus unlike consensus, has no binary version, now that we characterize m-set consensus through simultaneous consensus, the notion of binary-set-consensus is well defined. We have then showed that binary-set-consensus is equivalent to set consensus as it was with consensus."

The MOFS (Multi Object Fuzzy Segmentation) algorithm has been successfully applied to the segmentation of images from several modalities. However, the traditional MOFS algorithm fails when applied to images whose composing objects are characterized by textures whose patterns cannot be successfully described by simple statistics computed over a very restricted area. Here, we present an extension of the MOFS algorithm that achieves the segmentation of textures by employing adaptive affinity functions that use the Skew Divergence as a measure of distance between two distributions. These affinity functions are called adaptive because their associated area (neighborhood) changes according to the characteristics of the texture being processed. We performed experiments on mosaic images composed by combining rock sample images which show the effectiveness of the adaptive skew divergence based fuzzy affinity functions."

These estimations are done for two important purposes: The first is for the estimation of the forces and parameters needed for vehicle control, while the second is for the diagnosis preview based on the safety region for each parameter and state. For that purpose, the model of the vehicle is divided in two parts, in the first, the dynamical equations of the wheels are used to estimate their longitudinal forces and angular velocities. The estimations of the longitudinal forces are realized using a second order SM observer based on a super-twisting algorithm. In the second part, the estimated longitudinal forces are injected in the reduced state space equations representing the vehicle, which are the equations of side slip angle, yaw rate and the velocity of the vehicle. Estimations in this part are based on the principles of the classical SM observer. In this part the observability of the model is studied. The model takes as input the yaw rate and estimates the side slip angle and the velocity. Validation with the simulator VE-DYNA, at each step, pointed out the good performance and the robustness of the proposed observers"

The solution to this problem requires to apply optimization techniques capable of design the best path routes that guarantee to collect all the waste minimizing the cost. Several computation techniques could be applied to solve this problem and one of the most suitable could be swarm optimization such as ant colony optimization. In this paper, we propose a methodology for searching a set of collection paths of solid waste that optimize the distance of a tour in Ciudad Universitaria (UNAM). This methodology uses a vehicle routing problem (VRP) approach combined with Max-Min Ant System algorithm.

In a previous paper we talked about the assumptions related to the possibility, the necessity, and the limits of representing problem solving by mechanical means. In this paper we discuss general assumptions that have to do with considerations of method. Among the assumptions, we start with the idea that mechanical intelligence can be seen as the application of some method. Specifically, TM’s embody a method for information processing through syntactical transformation. Such transformation is achieved via following rules that specify a sequence of actions, and the specification of such rules must be unambiguous and have a certain indifference to time and the past. The specific assumptions about the method are that it is mechanical, finite, with identifiable results, disregarding in a certain sense time and space. We also discuss what might happen if the assumptions were to be rejected or weakened. We hope that tinkering with these assumptions will help to shed light on the import of alternative computational models."

The definition and limits of the physical realizability of these constructions are controversial issues at the moment and the subject of intense debate. In this paper, we consider a simple and particular case, namely, the physical realizability of the enumeration of rational numbers by Cantor’s diagonalization by means of an Ising system. We contend that uncertainty in determining a particular state in an Ising system renders impossible to have a reliable implementation of Cantor’s diagonal method and therefore a stronger physical system is required. We also point out what are the particular limitations of this system from the perspective of physical realizability."

These robots have no a priori knowledge of the topology of the graph, or of its size. Each edge has to be traversed by at least one robot. We first show that, for any set of q non-cooperative K-state robots, there exists a graph of size O(qK) that no robot of this set can explore. This improves the O(K O(q)) bound by Rollik (1980). Our main result is an application of this improvement. It concerns exploration with stop, in which one robot has to explore and stop after completing exploration. For this task, the robot is provided with a pebble, that it can use to mark nodes. We prove that exploration with stop requires Ω(log n) bits for the family of graphs with at most n nodes. On the other hand, we prove that there exists an exploration with stop algorithm using a robot with O(D log Δ) bits of memory to explore all graphs of diameter at most D and degree at most Δ."

However as the skull thickens, it obstructs the transmission of the acoustic waves, which in turn occludes the anatomy behind the thickened fetal skull. A viable option to improve the visibility of the fetal brain, before complete calcification of the skull, is the calculation of a compounded image made of different views of the same anatomical plane. In this work we report a new method for the composition of ultrasound images based on the Weighted Mean of the pixels, from different views, which correspond to each position (x, y) in the final compounded image. A support vector machine (SVM) is used to calculate the weights of each pixel from a different view, based on intensity, entropy and variance features. We present the initial test results of our method on synthetic US images of a head phantom, contaminated with speckle noise; we report the signal to noise ratio (SNR) and the normalized mutual information (NMI), for different number of views (2, 3, and 5), and compare the results against images compounded using the Mean, Root Mean Square (RMS), and Geometrical Mean composition methods. With our scheme we were able to recover the occluded information to increase the NMI from 16% to 26%, representing a 58% improvement."

The proposed approach is based on the spatial composition of multiple 3-D fetal head projections using the weighted Euclidean norm as an operator. A support vector machine, which is trained with optimal textural features, was used to assign weighting according to the posterior probabilities of brain tissue and shadows. Both phantom and real fetal head ultrasound volumes were compounded using previously reported operators and compared with the proposed composition method to validate it. The quantitative evaluations revealed increases in signal-to-noise ratio <= 35% and in contrast-to-noise ratio <= 135% using real data. Qualitative comparisons made by obstetricians indicated that this novel method adequately recovers brain tissue and improves the visibility of the main cerebral structures. This may prove useful both for fetal monitoring and in the diagnosis of brain defects. Overall this new approach outperforms spatial composition methods previously reported.

The sample was selected from the Shapley Ames Catalog, with IRAS fluxes characteristic of star formation and a dust temperature above Td ≥ 25 K. The study is aimed at identifying the global distribution and the underlying symmetries of the structures of ionized gas in barred galaxies. Thirty-two galaxies present Hα emission from the innermost central regions, but the emission from nuclear rings is observed only in ten galaxies. About half of the observed galaxies show Hα emission from several regions in the disk, and 18 galaxies display emission from along the bar. The Hα emission from inner and outer rings are easily identified in some galaxies. Some other galaxies present a more complicated spatial distributions, probably due to tidal or direct encounters with neighboring galaxies."

We also introduce a related parameter, winst, which measures the stability only for certain geodesics, and for which we also prove lower bounds."

Based only on the continuous output information, an observer is proposed ensuring the reconstruction of the entire state (continuous and discrete) in finite time. For the observer design an exact sliding mode differentiator is used, which allows the finite time convergence of the observer trajectories to the actual trajectories. The design scheme includes both cases: zero control input and nonzero control input. Simulations illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed observer.

In this work, we present the results of the segmentation of the fetal cerebellum applying statistical shape and appearance models. Both models were tested on ultrasound images of the fetal brain taken from 23 pregnant women, between 18 and 24 gestational weeks. The accuracy results obtained on 11 ultrasound images show a mean Hausdorff distance of 6.08 mm between the manual segmentation and the segmentation using active shape model, and a mean Hausdorff distance of 7.54 mm between the manual segmentation and the segmentation using active appearance model. The reported results demonstrate that the active shape model is more robust in the segmentation of the fetal cerebellum in ultrasound images."

This study address how susceptible is the steady state VO2, VCO2 measurement condition to the clino-orthostatic physiological maneuver. 30 young healthy subjects were analyzed. Only 18 passed the 10% variation coefficient inclusive criteria. They were exposed to 10 minutes clino-stage and 10 minutes orthostage. The hypothesis tests show not statistical significance (p 0.1) in the average and variance analysis.

One of the most important aspects of this kind of concealment derives from the amount of data that a host file (audio, images, data, or video) can hold. In this particular case, both the host and the hidden files are audio files. The amount of information that can be hiddenwith the suggested technique-occupies half the length of the host file. Furthermore, the use of the Hermite Transform on audio files helps improve the algorithm performance. Experimental results show that our proposal is efficient and effective, because the audio file concealment is imperceptible to human hearing. Performance of our proposal was assessed using correlation and peak signal to noise ratio. The results strengthen the effectiveness of the method. © 2014 NSP Natural Sciences Publishing Cor."

He thereby provides a neat mathematical formulation of the sensorimotor account of perceptual presence, i.e., of the fact that we perceive a whole object while being limited to seeing it from a perspective. Synesthetic concurrents are explained in terms of impoverished counterfactuals. I argue that this explanation misses its target, because it only accounts for a lack of objecthood. Enactive theory is better suited to explain concurrents' lack of subjectivity veridicality. The world itself shapes experience only during veridical perception."

We show that in a finite-sized cortical attractor network, this can be an advantage, for it leads to probabilistic behavior that is advantageous in decision-making, by preventing deadlock, and is important in signal detectability. We show how computations can be performed through stochastic dynamical effects, including the role of noise in enabling probabilistic jumping across barriers in the energy landscape describing the flow of the dynamics in attractor networks. The results obtained in neurophysiological studies of decision-making and signal detectability are modelled by the stochastical neurodynamics of integrate-and-fire networks of neurons with probabilistic neuronal spiking. We describe how these stochastic neurodynamical effects can be analyzed, and their importance in many aspects of brain function, including decision-making, memory recall, short-term memory, and attention. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Among these, the most common are jamming-based denial of service (DoS) attacks, which result in packet loss. The concept of a honeypot node or honeynode has been explored for wireless networks and has shown to be effective in attracting attacks, thus deterring the jammers from productive nodes. Yet a single dedicated honeynode, on account of its permanent idleness, is wasteful of an entire node as resource. In this paper, we seek to resolve this dilemma by dynamically selecting the honeynode for each transmission period, and we explore various methods of doing so. To begin with, we develop the first comprehensive queuing model for CRNs, which pose unique modeling challenges due to their periodic sensing and transmission cycles. We then build a simulation of CRNs under attack from jammers, introduce a series of strategies for honeynode assignment to combat these attacks, and assess the performance of each strategy. We find that the predictions of our mathematical model track closely with the results of our simulation experiments."

18508,Strategy to allow the inspection of the deep drainage system of Mexico City,2005,Ramón Domínguez Mora,Instituto de Ingeniería (II),,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-17044382900&partnerID=40&md5=aa9851702d2e10399470230384f0a433,RS,Engineering,Deep drainage; Drainage simulation; Mexico; Urban drainage,"After the inauguration of Mexico City's Deep Drainage System (DDS) in 1975, the wastewater drainage capacity increased substantially. The original design assumed DDS operation during the rainy season, to avoid flooding of the city, and inspection during the dry season, when urban waste-water would drain through surface channels. Over-exploitation of the aquifer beneath the city to increase potable water supply caused differential subsidence of the ground, which in turn decreased the capacity of surface channels from 60 to 7 m3 s-1. This situation forced the continuous operation of the DDS, interrupting its inspection for ten years. Given this context, added to construction delays for important drainage works, it is imperative to update the design, to comply with the city's Drainage Master Plan. In this paper we present the results of hydraulic simulations and the resulting proposal of changes to the system and its operation to permit scheduled yearly inspections."

The 3-D Freeman chain code and the five orthogonal change chain directions (5OT) chain code are compared. The 3-D Freeman chain code consists of 26 directions, in 3-D Euclidean space, with no invariance under rotation. The 5OT chain elements represent the orthogonal direction changes of the contiguous straight-line segments of the discrete curve. This chain code only considers relative direction changes, which allows us to have a curve descriptor invariant under rotation, and mirroring curves may be obtained with ease. In the 2-D domain, Freeman chain codes are widely used to represent contour curves. Until now, the authors have had no information of implementing Freeman chain codes to compress 3-D curves. Our contribution is how to implement the Freeeman chain code in 3-D and how to compare it with the recently proposed 5OT code. Finally, to probe our results, we apply the proposed method to three different cases: arbitrary curves, cube-filling Hilbert curves, and lattice knots."

18539,Superiorization of the ML-EM Algorithm,2014,Edgar Garduño Angeles,Instituto de Investigaciones en Matemáticas Aplicadas y en Sistemas (IIMAS),,,0018-9499,10.1109/TNS.2013.2283529,,SIAV,Computer Science,Algorithm; evaluation; expectation maximization; Kullback-Leibler distance; maximum likelihood; optimization; positron emission tomography; stopping rule; superiorization,"A reconstructed image in positron emission tomography (PET) should be such that its likelihood, assuming a Poisson model, is high given the observed detector readings. The expectation maximization (EM) methodology leads to an iterative algorithm, called ML-EM, that converges in the limit to an image that maximizes this likelihood. An undesirable property of the algorithm is that it produces images with irregular high amplitude patterns as the number of iterations increases. One approach to alleviate these high amplitude patterns is to use a stopping rule that terminates the process before the appearance of the undesirable high amplitude patterns; one recently-proposed stopping rule results in the method called MLEM-STOP. This paper takes a different approach by applying the recently developed superiorization methodology to ML-EM. Superiorization is an automated procedure for turning an iterative algorithm for producing images that satisfy a primary criterion (in our case that of having a high likelihood given the observed detector readings) into its superiorized version that will be as good as the original algorithm according to the primary criterion, but will in addition produce images that are also good according to a secondary criterion. The approach is demonstrated for two secondary criteria, one provided by an assumed Gaussian prior distribution and the other based on total variation minimization. It is demonstrated that the superiorization methodology achieves its aim for both these criteria. It is further shown by a study, using statistical hypothesis testing on simulated collection of PET data from the human head, that for either secondary criterion the superiorized version of ML-EM outperforms MLEM-STOP for the task of estimating activity within neuroanatomical structures."

Methods: The superiorization methodology is presented as a heuristic solver for a large class of constrained optimization problems. The constraints come from the desire to produce a solution that is constraints-compatible, in the sense of meeting requirements provided by physically or otherwise obtained constraints. The underlying idea is that many iterative algorithms for finding such a solution are perturbation resilient in the sense that, even if certain kinds of changes are made at the end of each iterative step, the algorithm still produces a constraints-compatible solution. This property is exploited by using permitted changes to steer the algorithm to a solution that is not only constraints-compatible, but is also desirable according to a specified optimization criterion. The approach is very general, it is applicable to many iterative procedures and optimization criteria used in medical physics. Results: The main practical contribution is a procedure for automatically producing from any given iterative algorithm its superiorized version, which will supply solutions that are superior according to a given optimization criterion. It is shown that if the original iterative algorithm satisfies certain mathematical conditions, then the output of its superiorized version is guaranteed to be as constraints-compatible as the output of the original algorithm, but it is superior to the latter according to the optimization criterion. This intuitive description is made precise in the paper and the stated claims are rigorously proved. Superiorization is illustrated on simulated computerized tomography data of a head cross section and, in spite of its generality, superiorization is shown to be competitive to an optimization algorithm that is specifically designed to minimize total variation. Conclusions: The range of applicability of superiorization to constrained optimization problems is very large. Its major utility is in the automatic nature of producing a superiorization algorithm from an algorithm aimed at only constraints-compatibility; while nonheuristic (exact) approaches need to be redesigned for a new optimization criterion. Thus superiorization provides a quick route to algorithms for the practical solution of constrained optimization problems. (c) 2012 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.

Brain states reliably switch between distinct spatiotemporal signatures at a network scale even though they are composed of heterogeneous and variable rhythms at a cellular scale. We investigated the mechanisms of this network control in a conductance-based population model that reliably switches between active and oscillatory mean-fields. Robust control of the mean-field properties relies critically on a switchable negative intrinsic conductance at the cellular level. This conductance endows circuits with a shared cellular positive feedback that can switch population rhythms on and off at a cellular resolution. The switch is largely independent from other intrinsic neuronal properties, network size and synaptic connectivity. It is therefore compatible with the temporal variability and spatial heterogeneity induced by slower regulatory functions such as neuromodulation, synaptic plasticity and homeostasis. Strikingly, the required cellular mechanism is available in all cell types that possess T-type calcium channels but unavailable in computational models that neglect the slow kinetics of their activation. © 2018 Drion et al."

Previous work considered mostly the asynchronous model of computation. This paper studies conditions for consensus in a synchronous system where processes can fail by crashing. It describes a full classification of conditions for consensus, establishing a continuum between the asynchronous and synchronous models, with the following hierarchy S t [-t] ⊂ ⋯ ⊂ S t [0] ⊂ C ⋯ ⊂ S t [t] where S t [t] includes all conditions (and in particular the trivial one made up of all possible input vectors). For a condition C ε S t [d], -t ≤ d ≤ t, we have: For values of d ≤ 0 consensus is solvable in an asynchronous system with t failures, and we obtain the known hierarchy of conditions that allows solving asynchronous consensus with more and more efficient protocols as we go from d = 0 to d = -t. For values of d &gt; 0 consensus is known not solvable in an asynchronous system with t failures, but we obtain a hierarchy of conditions that allows solving synchronous consensus with protocols that can take more and more rounds, as we go from d = 0 to d = t. d = 0 is the borderline case where consensus can be solved in an asynchronous system with t failures, and can be solved optimally in a synchronous system. After having established the complete hierarchy, the paper concentrates on the two last items: 0 ≤ d ≤ t. The main result is that the necessary and sufficient number of rounds needed to solve uniform consensus for a condition C ε S t [d] (such that C ∉ S t [d+1] is d + 1. In more detail, the paper presents a generic synchronous early-deciding uniform consensus protocol that enjoys the following properties. Let f be the number of actual crashes, I the input vector and C ε S t [d] the condition the protocol is instantiated with. The protocol terminates in two rounds when I ε C and f ≤ t - d, and in at most d + 1 rounds when I ε C and f &gt; t - d. (It also terminates in one round when I ε C and d = f = 0.) Moreover, whether I belongs or not to C, no process requires more than min(t + 1, f + 2) rounds to decide. The paper then proves a corresponding lower bound stating that at least d + 1 rounds are necessary to get a decision in the worst case when I ε C (for C ε S t [d] and C ∉ S t [d-1]."

This has been further facilitated by the increasing availability of experimental data on gene-gene, protein-protein and gene-protein interactions. The two dynamical properties that are often experimentally testable are perturbations and stable steady states. Although a lot of work has been done on the identification of steady states, not much work has been reported on in silico modeling of cellular differentiation processes. Results: In this manuscript, we provide algorithms based on reduced ordered binary decision diagrams (ROBDDs) for Boolean modeling of gene regulatory networks. Algorithms for synchronous and asynchronous transition models have been proposed and their corresponding computational properties have been analyzed. These algorithms allow users to compute cyclic attractors of large networks that are currently not feasible using existing software. Hereby we provide a framework to analyze the effect of multiple gene perturbation protocols, and their effect on cell differentiation processes. These algorithms were validated on the T-helper model showing the correct steady state identification and Th1-Th2 cellular differentiation process. © 2008 The Author(s)."

It allows each process to write a value and obtains a set of pairs (process id, value) such that, despite process crashes and asynchrony, the sets obtained by the processes satisfy noteworthy inclusion properties. Considering an n-process model in which up to t processes are allowed to crash (t-crash system model), this paper is on the construction of t-resilient immediate snapshot objects. In the t-crash system model, a process can obtain values from at least   (n−t)  processes, and, consequently, t-immediate snapshot is assumed to have the properties of the basic   (n−1) -resilient immediate snapshot plus the additional property stating that each process obtains values from at least   (n−t)  processes. The main result of the paper is the following. While there is a (deterministic)   (n−1) -resilient algorithm implementing the basic   (n−1) -immediate snapshot in an   (n−1) -crash read/write system, there is no t-resilient algorithm in a t-crash read/write model when   t∈[1…(n−2)] . This means that, when   t<n−1 , the notion of t-resilience is inoperative when one has to implement t-immediate snapshot for these values of t: the model assumption “at most   t<n−1  processes may crash” does not provide us with additional computational power allowing for the design of a genuine t-resilient algorithm (genuine meaning that such an algorithm would work in the t-crash model, but not in the   (t+1) -crash model). To show these results, the paper relies on well-known distributed computing agreement problems such as consensus and k-set agreement."

Such systems show radically different behaviours at different scales and in different environments, and mathematical modelling of such emergent behaviour is very difficult, even at the conceptual level. We require a new methodology to study and understand complex, emergent macroscopic phenomena. Coarse graining, a technique that originated in statistical physics, involves taking a system with many microscopic degrees of freedom and finding an appropriate subset of collective variables that offer a compact, computationally feasible description of the system, in terms of which the dynamics looks “natural”. This paper presents the key ideas of the approach and shows how it can be applied to evolutionary dynamics. "

Slight errors in the reasoning are difficult to find, calling for computer-checked proof systems. In order to build computer-checked proofs with usual tools, such as Coq or TLA+, having sequential specifications of all base objects that are used as building blocks in a given algorithm is a requisite to provide a modular proof built by composition. Alas, many concurrent objects do not have a sequential specification. This article describes a systematic method to transform any task, a specification method that captures concurrent one-shot distributed problems, into a sequential specification involving two calls, set and get. This transformation allows system designers to compose proofs, thus providing a framework for modular computer-checked proofs of algorithms designed using tasks and sequential objects as building blocks. The Moir&Anderson implementation of renaming using splitters is an iconic example of such algorithms designed by composition."

Nevertheless, there are many factors impacting productivity in ASD. After conducting a Systematic Mapping Study, it was noted that many of the factors affecting productivity in ASD are related to team aspects. Social science states that mature teams can reach high productivity levels, but in Software Engineering there is a lack of research on that topic. Due to the above, a study was designed to determine the impact of team maturity on productivity in ASD. This work describes the research proposal."

The slave robots are analysed as a cooperative system where it is assumed that the robots can push but not pull the object. In order to achieve a stable rigid grasp, a centralised adaptive position-force control algorithm for the slave robots is proposed. On the other hand, a linear velocity observer for the master robot is developed to avoid numerical differentiation. A set of experiments with different human operators were carried out to show the good performance and capabilities of the proposed control-observer algorithm. In addition, the dynamic model and closed-loop dynamics of the telemanipulation is presented."

Our proposed synchronizer is optimistic in the sense that it uses very efficient but tentative protocols to simulate a contiguous block of synchronous steps. However, since a tentative execution does not guarantee correct simulation, we audit the computation at selected points. The audits are used to check whether the computation of the block can be certified to be correct. We show that a wide class of networks of limited asynchrony admits practical tentative protocols which are highly likely to produce a correct simulation of one step with very small overhead. For those networks, the synchronizer exhibits a trade off between its communication and time complexities which is below the lower bounds for deterministic synchronizers. On one extreme the amortized complexity of our synchronizer is O(1) messages and O(log n) time (expected) per “step” of the simulated synchronous protocol. On the other extreme the communication complexity is O(e/Δ2) and the time complexity is O(log Δ), for networks with e edges and maximum degree Δ"

Writing skills evolve differently depending on external factors, such as the conditions in which children practice their productions and the quality of their instructors' guidance. This can be challenging in low-income areas, where schools may struggle to ensure ideal acquisition conditions. Developing computational tools to support the learning process may counterweight negative environmental influences; however, few work exists on the use of information technologies to improve childhood literacy. This work centers around the computational study of Spanish word and syllable structure in documents written by 2nd and 3rd year elementary school students. The studied texts were compared against a corpus of short stories aimed at the same age group, so as to observe whether the children tend to produce similar written patterns as the ones they are expected to interpret at their literacy level. The obtained results show some significant differences between the two kinds of texts, pointing towards possible strategies for the implementation of new education software in support of written language acquisition."

However, Gabor filters have not zero mean, which produces a non-uniform coverage of the Fourier domain. This distortion causes fairly poor pattern retrieval accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet efficient image retrieval approach based on a novel log-Gabor filter scheme. We make emphasis on the filter design to preserve the relationship with receptive fields and take advantage of their strong orientation selectivity. We provide an experimental evaluation of both Gabor and log-Gabor features using two metrics, the Kullback-Leibler (D KL) and the Jensen-Shannon divergence (D JS). The experiments with the USC-SIPI database confirm that our proposal shows better retrieval performance than the classic Gabor features. 3 © 2012 Springer-Verlag."

In this, a novel collocation method—TH-collocation—is applied to the biharmonic equation and the merits of such procedure are exhibited. TH-collocation relaxes the continuity requirements and, for the 2D problems here treated, leads to the development of algorithms for which the matrices are sparse (nine-diagonal), symmetric and positive definite. Due to these properties, the conjugate gradient method can be directly, and more effectively, applied to them. These features contrast with those of the standard orthogonal spline collocation on cubic Hermites, which yields matrices that are non-symmetric and non-positive. This paper is part of a line of research in which a general and unified theory of domain decomposition methods, proposed by Herrera, is being explored. Two kinds of contributions can be distinguished in this; some that are relevant for the parallel computation of continuous models and new discretization procedures for partial differential equations. The present paper belongs to this latter kind of contributions."

In this regard, there is an increasing interest in the development of methods that allow the systematic identification of these evolutionary events in metabolism. Here, we used a method not based on biomolecular sequence analysis to compare and identify common and variable routes in the metabolism of 40 Gammaproteobacteria species. Method: The metabolic maps deposited in the KEGG database were transformed into linear Enzymatic Step Sequences (ESS) by using the breadth-first search algorithm. These ESS represent subsequent enzymes linked to each other, where their catalytic activities are encoded in the Enzyme Commission numbers. The ESS were compared in an all-against-all (pairwise comparisons) approach by using a dynamic programming algorithm, leaving only a set of significant pairs. Results and conclusion: From these comparisons, we identified a set of functionally conserved enzymatic steps in different metabolic maps, in which cell wall components and fatty acid and lysine biosynthesis were included. In addition, we found that pathways associated with biosynthesis share a higher proportion of similar ESS than degradation pathways and secondary metabolism pathways. Also, maps associated with the metabolism of similar compounds contain a high proportion of similar ESS, such as those maps from nucleotide metabolism pathways, in particular the inosine monophosphate pathway.

This has had the effect of restricting research to the problem of stability, as epitomized by the concept of the hypercycle and its potential vulnerability against parasites. Stability is typically assumed to be ensured by a rigid compartment, but spatial self-structuring is a viable alternative. We further develop this alternative by proposing that some instability can actually be beneficial under certain conditions. We show that instability can lead to adaptive behavior even in the case of simple prebiotic reaction-diffusion systems. We demonstrate for the first time that a parasitic sidereaction on the metabolic level can lead to self-motility on the behavioral level of the chemical system as a whole. Moreover, self-motility entails advantages on an evolutionary level, thus constituting a symbiotic, behavior-based hypercycle. We relate this novel finding to several issues in the science of the origin of life, and conclude that more attention should be given to the possibility of a movement-first scenario."

Applying this simulation algorithm to the k-set-agreement problem enables conversion of an arbitrary k-fault-tolerant n-process solution for the k-set-agreement problem into a wait-free k + 1-process solution for the same problem. Since the k + 1-process k-set-agreement problem has been shown to have no wait-free solution [5,18,26], this transformation implies that there is no k-fault-tolerant solution to the n-process k-set-agreement problem, for any n. More generally, the algorithm satisfies the requirements of a fault-tolerant distributed simulation. The distributed simulation implements a notion of fault-tolerant reducibility between decision problems. This paper defines these notions and gives examples of their application to fundamental distributed computing problems. The algorithm is presented and verified in terms of I/O automata. The presentation has a great deal of interesting modularity, expressed by I/O automaton composition and both forward and backward simulation relations. Composition is used to include a safe agreement module as a subroutine. Forward and backward simulation relations are used to view the algorithm as implementing a multi-try snapshot strategy. The main algorithm works in snapshot shared memory systems; a simple modification of the algorithm that works in read/write shared memory systems is also presented."

The prevalence of opioid addiction prior to his publication had risen in several countries including England, France and Germany. He was the first to call it an illness, but doubted that it was a mental illness because the impairment of volition appeared to be restricted to opioid use: it was not pervasive, since it did not extend to other aspects of the individuals' life. While there has been huge progress in understanding the underlying neurobiological mechanisms, there has been little progress in the clinical psychopathology of addiction and in understanding how it relates to these neurobiological mechanisms. A focus on cravings has limited the exploration of other important aspects such as anosognosia and addiction-related behaviors like smuggling opioids into treatment and supporting the continued provision of co-patients. These behaviors are usually considered secondary reactions, but in clinical practice they appear to be central to addiction, indicating that an improved understanding of the complexity of the disorder is needed. We propose to consider an approach that takes into account the embodied, situated, dynamic, and phenomenological aspects of mental processes. Addiction in this context can be conceptualized as a habit, understood as a distributed network of mental, behavioral, and social processes, which not only shapes the addict's perceptions and actions, but also has a tendency to self-maintain. Such an approach may help to develop and integrate psychopathological and neurobiological research and practice of addictions."

An orthogonal approach that has been used is to consider conditions that restrict the possible inputs to such a problem. This paper considers a system with both failure detectors and conditions. The aim is to identify the failure detector class that abstracts away the synchrony needed to solve k-set agreement for a given condition. Three main contributions are presented. The first is a new class of failure detectors denoted φ ty, 0 ≤ y ≤ t. The processes can invoke a primitive QUERYy(S) with a set of process ids S. Roughly speaking, QUERY y(S) returns true only when all processes in S have crashed, provided t - y &lt; |S| ≤ t. It is shown that the classic Chandra and Toueg's failure detectors are incomparable to the φty failure detectors. The second contribution is a generic condition-based protocol for φty that solves k-set agreement. It can be instantiated with any (t - d)-legal condition C and solves k-set agreement for k = 1 + max(0, d - y); termination is guaranteed for inputs in C. (A condition is x-legal if and only if it can be used to solve x-fault tolerant asynchronous consensus.) A variant of the protocol that terminates always is described. Finally, a corresponding lower bound is presented showing that there is no φty-based k-set agreement protocol for (t-d)-legal conditions with k ≤ max(0, d - y). Copyright 2005 ACM."

While set agreement generalizes consensus in terms of the number of decisions allowed, the CD problem generalizes consensus in the sense of considering many instances of consensus and requiring a processor to decide in at least one instance. In more detail, in the CD problem each one of a set of n processes has a (possibly distinct) value to propose to each one of a set of b consensus problems, which we call committees. Yet a process has to decide a value for at least one of these committees, such that all processes deciding for the same committee decide the same value. We study the CD problem in the context of a wait-free distributed system and analyze it using a combination of distributed algorithmic and topological techniques, introducing a novel reduction technique. We use the reduction technique to obtain the following results. We show that the (2, 3)-CD problem is equivalent to the musical benches problem introduced by Gafni and Rajsbaum in [10], and both are equivalent to (2, 3)-set agreement, closing an open question left there. Thus, all three problems are wait-free unsolvable in a read/write shared memory system, and they are all solvable if the system is enriched with objects capable of solving (2, 3)-set agreement. While the previous proof of the impossibility of musical benches was based on the Borsuk-Ulam (BU) Theorem, it now relies on Sperner’s Lemma, opening intriguing questions about the relation between BU and distributed computing tasks."
20057,The direct perception hypothesis: perceiving the intention of another's action hinders its precise imitation,2014,Tom Froese,Instituto de Investigaciones en Matemáticas Aplicadas y en Sistemas (IIMAS),Instituto de Ciencias Nucleares (ICN),,1664-1078,10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00065,,IA,Psychology,phenomenology; perception; symbolic culture; development; chimpanzee; social cognition; enculturation; comparative psychology;CHIMPANZEES PAN-TROGLODYTES; TOOL USE; SOCIAL COGNITION; HOMO-SAPIENS; INATTENTIONAL BLINDNESS; CATEGORICAL PERCEPTION; RATIONAL IMITATION; CHILDREN; OVERIMITATION; NORMATIVITY,"We argue that imitation is a learning response to unintelligible actions, especially to social conventions. Various strands of evidence are converging on this conclusion, but further progress has been hampered by an outdated theory of perceptual experience. Comparative psychology continues to be premised on the doctrine that humans and non-human primates only perceive others' physical surface behavior, while mental states are perceptually inaccessible. However, a growing consensus in social cognition research accepts the direct perception hypothesis: primarily we see what others aim to do; we do not infer it from their motions. Indeed, physical details are overlooked unless the action is unintelligible. On this basis we hypothesize that apes' propensity to copy the goal of an action, rather than its precise means, is largely dependent on its perceived intelligibility. Conversely, children copy means more often than adults and apes because, uniquely, much adult human behavior is completely unintelligible to unenculturated observers due to the pervasiveness of arbitrary social conventions, as exemplified by customs, rituals, and languages. We expect the propensity to imitate to be inversely correlated with the familiarity of cultural practices, as indexed by age and/or socio-cultural competence. The direct perception hypothesis thereby helps to parsimoniously explain the most important findings of imitation research, including children's over-imitation and other species-typical and age-related variations."

A general challenge is to better understand the relationship between neural organization and neural activity at the system level, including the functional roles of inhibitory connections. Here we implemented an abstract simulation model of the C. elegans connectome that approximates the neurotransmitter identity of each neuron, and we explored the functional role of these physiological differences for neural activity. In particular, we created a Hopfield neural network in which all of the worm's neurons characterized by inhibitory neurotransmitters are assigned inhibitory outgoing connections. Then, we created a control condition in which the same number of inhibitory connections are arbitrarily distributed across the network. A comparison of these two conditions revealed that the biological distribution of inhibitory connections facilitates the self-optimization of coordinated neural activity compared with an arbitrary distribution of inhibitory connections. © 2020 IEEE."

In this paper we study some structural properties of $${\mathcal{E} \mathcal{R} \mathcal{G}(P,k)}$$, such as its connectivity and diameter. We show that if the vertices of $${\mathcal{E} \mathcal{R} \mathcal{G}(P,k)}$$are not triangulations of P, then it is connected and has diameter O(n2). We also show that the chromatic number of $${\mathcal{E} \mathcal{R} \mathcal{G}(P,k)}$$is O(n), and show how to compute an implicit coloring of its vertices.

18767,The Enactive Approach to Habits: New Concepts for the Cognitive Science of Bad Habits and Addiction,2019,Tom Froese,Instituto de Investigaciones en Matemáticas Aplicadas y en Sistemas (IIMAS),Instituto de Ciencias Nucleares (ICN),,1664-1078,10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00301,,IA,Psychology,4E cognition; dynamical approach; agency; sense-making; regional identities; self; mind-body dualism;ORGANIZATIONAL ROUTINES; PSYCHEDELIC DRUGS; BEHAVIOR; AUTOMATICITY; MEMORY; MIND; PSYCHOLOGY; KNOWLEDGE; SYSTEMS; CREATE,"Habits are the topic of a venerable history of research that extends back to antiquity, yet they were originally disregarded by the cognitive sciences. They started to become the focus of interdisciplinary research in the 1990s, but since then there has been a stalemate between those who approach habits as a kind of bodily automatism or as a kind of mindful action. This implicit mind-body dualism is ready to be overcome with the rise of interest in embodied, embedded, extended, and enactive (4E) cognition. We review the enactive approach and highlight how it moves beyond the traditional stalemate by integrating both autonomy and sense-making into its theory of agency. It defines a habit as an adaptive, precarious, and self-sustaining network of neural, bodily, and interactive processes that generate dynamical sensorimotor patterns. Habits constitute a central source of normativity for the agent. We identify a potential shortcoming of this enactive account with respect to bad habits, since self-maintenance of a habit would always be intrinsically good. Nevertheless, this is only a problem if, following the mainstream perspective on habits, we treat habits as isolated modules. The enactive approach replaces this atomism with a view of habits as constituting an interdependent whole on whose overall viability the individual habits depend. Accordingly, we propose to define a bad habit as one whose expression, while positive for itself, significantly impairs a person's well-being by overruling the expression of other situationally relevant habits. We conclude by considering implications of this concept of bad habit for psychological and psychiatric research, particularly with respect to addiction research."

Exemplifying this shift, the enactive approach points to an essential role of goal-directed bodily activity in the generation of meaningful perceptual experience, i.e., sense-making. Here, building on recent insights into the transformative effects of practical tool-use, we make use of the enactive approach in order to provide a definition of an enactive interface in terms of augmented sense-making. We introduce such a custom-built interface, the Enactive Torch, and present a study of its experiential effects. The results demonstrate that the user experience is not adequately captured by any standardly assumed perceptual modality; rather, it is a new feeling that is mediated by the design of the device and shaped by the overall situation of the task. Taken together these findings show that there is much to be gained by synergies between engineering and the cognitive sciences in the creation of new experience-centered technology. We suggest that the guiding principle should be the design of interfaces that serve as a transparent medium for augmenting our natural skills of interaction with the world, instead of requiring conscious attention to the interface as an opaque object in the world."
20077,The expert surgical assistant An intelligent virtual environment with multimodal input,1996,Jesús Savage Carmona,Facultad de Ingeniería,,,,10.3233/978-1-60750-873-1-590,https://ebooks.iospress.nl/volumearticle/15913,TC,Computer Vision,,"Virtual Reality has made computer interfaces more intuitive but not more intelligent. This paper shows how an expert system can be coupled with multimodal input in a virtual environment to provide an intelligent simulation tool or surgical assistant. This is accomplished in three steps. First, voice and gestural input is interpreted and represented in a common semantic form. Second, a rule-based expert system is used to infer context and user actions from this semantic representation. Finally, the inferred user actions are matched against steps in a surgical procedure to monitor the user’s progress and provide automatic feedback. In addition, the system can respond immediately to multimodal commands for navigational assistance and/or identification of critical anatomical structures. To show how these methods are used we present a prototype sinus surgery interface. The approach described here may easily be extended to a wide variety of medical and non-medical training applications by making simple changes to the expert system database and virtual environment models. Successful implementation of an expert system in both simulated and real surgery has enormous potential for the surgeon both in training and clinical practice"

We recorded and analyzed the real-time embodied social interaction of 10 pairs of adult participants. The results reveal a process of implicit perceptual learning: on average, clarity of perceiving the other's presence increased over trials and then stabilized. However, a clearer perception of the other was not associated with correctness of recognition as such, but with both players correctly recognizing each other. Furthermore, the moments of correct mutual recognition tended to happen within seconds. The fact that changes in social experience can only be explained by the successful performance at the level of the dyad, and that this veridical mutual perception tends toward synchronization, lead us to hypothesize that integration of neural activity across both players played a role."

This model includes some important properties of human visual perception, such as local orientation analysis and the Guassian derivative model of early vision. Local analysis is achieved by windowing the image with a Gaussian function, then a local expansion into orthogonal polynomials takes place at every window position. Expansion coefficients are called Hermite coefficients and it is shown that they can be directly obtained by convolving the image with Gaussian derivative filters, in agreement with psychophysical insights of human visual perception. A compact representation can be obtained by locally steering the Hermite coefficients towards the direction of local maximum energy. Image fusion is achieved by combining the steered Hermite coefficients of both source images with the method of verification of consistency. Fusion results are compared with a competitive wavelet-bascd technique, proving that the Hermite transform provides better reconstruction of relevant image structures. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

There exist methods for flooding a network intelligently and for scheduling node activities. Dominating sets and neighbor elimination based broadcasting is currently the most efficient broadcasting scheme in terms of the number of retransmitted messages to complete a broadcast. It provides basis for defining other broadcasting protocols by changing the definition of the delay (timeout) function used to decide how long a dominating node should wait before making a retransmission. In this article, we propose thirteen such variants. They are all reliable, meaning that all the nodes connected to a source will receive the message, assuming an ideal MAC layer. Eight of them are hexagonal based; four are distance-based, giving priority to the neighbors that are further or nearer from the retransmitting node; and one is using a random timeout. Beyond these variants, we propose three different ways to update the timeout values during a broadcasting process. Our experimental data shows that the updating process of the timeout values has no significant impact compared to the selected timeout function. From the thirteen variants we deliberately proposed some worst-case timeout functions to see its impact in the broadcasting process. We confirm by our experimental data that indeed the selected timeout function has an impact in the broadcasting process. Although our experimental data shows that the new further distance-based scheme outperforms almost all schemes in terms of number of messages to complete a broadcast, it also shows that a random function (the way IEEE 802.11 works) is a very good choice."

Complexity has recently shown that interactions-which reductionism neglects-are relevant for understanding phenomena. When interactions are considered, reductionism becomes limited in several aspects. In this paper, I argue that interactions imply nonreductionism, non-materialism, non-predictability, non-Platonism, and non-Nihilism. As alternatives to each of these, holism, informism, adaptation, contextuality, and meaningfulness are put forward, respectively. A worldview that includes interactions not only describes better our world, but can help to solve many open scientific, philosophical, and social problems caused by implications of reductionism."

However, some researchers have found neutrality to be beneficial for the evolutionary process while others have found it either useless or worse. We believe there are various reasons for these contradictory results: (a) many studies have based their conclusions using crossover and mutation as main operators rather than using only mutation (Kimura's studies were done analysing only mutations) and, (b) studies often consider problems and representation with larger complexity. The aim of this paper is to analyse how neutral mutations tend to behave in GP and establish how important they are. For this purpose we introduce an approach which has two advantages: (a) it allows us to specify neutrality and, (b) this makes possible to understand how neutrality affects the evolutionary search process. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006."

This theorem says that no distributed system in which processes coordinate using f-resilient atomic objects and reliable registers can solve the consensus problem in the presence of f+1 undetectable process stopping failures. In contrast, we show that it is possible to boost the resilience of some systems solving problems easier than consensus: for example, the 2-set-consensus problem is solvable for 2n processes and 2n-1 failures (i.e., wait-free) using n-process consensus services resilient to n-1 failures (wait-free). Our proof is short and self-contained. We then introduce the larger class of failure-oblivious services. These are services that cannot use information about failures, although they may behave more flexibly than atomic objects. An example of such a service is totally ordered broadcast. Our second theorem generalizes the first theorem and its proof to failure-oblivious services. Our third theorem allows the system to contain failure-aware services, such as failure detectors, in addition to failure-oblivious services. This theorem requires that each failure-aware service be connected to all processes; thus, f+1 process failures overall can disable all the failure-aware services. In contrast, it is possible to boost the resilience of a system solving consensus using failure-aware services if arbitrary connection patterns between processes and services are allowed: consensus is solvable for any number of failures using only 1-resilient 2-process perfect failure detectors. As far as we know, this is the first time a unified framework has been used to describe both atomic and non-atomic objects, and the first time boosting analysis has been performed for services more general than atomic objects.

Nevertheless, the neural mechanisms underlying decision making are still not fully understood. Computational modeling has revealed itself as a valuable asset to address some of the fundamental questions. Biophysically plausible models, in particular, are useful in bridging the different levels of description that experimental studies provide, from the neural spiking activity recorded at the cellular level to the performance reported at the behavioral level. In this article, we have reviewed some of the recent progress made in the understanding of the neural mechanisms that underlie decision making. We have performed a critical evaluation of the available results and address, from a computational perspective, aspects of both experimentation and modeling that so far have eluded comprehension. To guide the discussion, we have selected a central theme which revolves around the following question: how does the spatiotemporal structure of sensory stimuli affect the perceptual decision-making process? This question is a timely one as several issues that still remain unresolved stem from this central theme. These include: (i) the role of spatiotemporal input fluctuations in perceptual decision making, (ii) how to extend the current results and models derived from two-alternative choice studies to scenarios with multiple competing evidences, and (iii) to establish whether different types of spatiotemporal input fluctuations affect decision-making outcomes in distinctive ways. And although we have restricted our discussion mostly to visual decisions, our main conclusions are arguably generalizable; hence, their possible extension to other sensory modalities is one of the points in our discussion. © 2014 Insabato et al."

Processes access the sequence of IS objects, one-by-one, asynchronously, in a wait-free manner; any number of processes can crash. Its interest lies in the elegant recursive structure of its runs, hence of the ease to analyze it round by round. In a very interesting way, Borowsky and Gafni have shown that the IIS model and the read/write model are equivalent for the wait-free solvability of decision tasks. This paper extends the benefits of the IIS model to partially synchronous systems. Given a shared memory model enriched with a failure detector, what is an equivalent IIS model? The paper shows that an elegant way of capturing the power of a failure detector and other partially synchronous systems in the IIS model is by restricting appropriately its set of runs, giving rise to the iterated restricted immediate snapshot model (IRIS)."

In Mexico, few studies exploring this kind of environment have been described. In this work, we explore the microbial community in Chignahuapan hot springs, which provides clues to understand these ecosystems’ diversity. We assessed the diversity of the microorganism communities in a hot spring environment with a metagenomic shotgun approach. Besides identifying similarities and differences with other ecosystems, we achieved a systematic comparison against 11 metagenomic samples from diverse localities. The Chignahuapan hot springs show a particular prevalence of sulfur-oxidizing bacteria from the genera Rhodococcus, Thermomonas, Thiomonas, Acinetobacter, Sulfurovum, and Bacillus, highlighting those that are different from other recovered bacterial populations in circumneutral hot springs environments around the world. The co-occurrence analysis of the bacteria and viruses in these environments revealed that within the Rhodococcus, Thiomonas, Thermonas, and Bacillus genera, the Chignahuapan samples have specific species of bacteria with a particular abundance, such as Rhodococcus erytropholis. The viruses in the circumneutral hot springs present bacteriophages within the order Caudovirales (Siphoviridae, Myoviridae, and Podoviridae), but the family of Herelleviridae was the most abundant in Chignahuapan samples. Furthermore, viral auxiliary metabolic genes were identified, many of which contribute mainly to the metabolism of cofactors and vitamins as well as carbohydrate metabolism. Nevertheless, the viruses and bacteria present in the circumneutral environments contribute to the sulfur cycle. This work represents an exhaustive characterization of a community structure in samples collected from hot springs in Mexico and opens opportunities to identify organisms of biotechnological interest. © 2020 by the authors.

In this paper, we investigate possible modulations in the feeling of ownership (sensation of owning a virtual hand) and of agency (sensation of owning virtual movements and actions) according to whether or not the participant's own motor acts (1) induce coherent self-activated visuotactile sensory stimulations; and (2) generate plausible consequences in the simulated environment. For this purpose, we elicited the VHI within a group of participants through a cross-modal integration of visuo-tactile sensory stimulations within a dynamic and physically plausible immersive virtual environment, where they were able to perform natural tasks in both passive and active agency conditions. Our results indicate that both feelings of ownership and agency can be achieved in immersive virtual environments, when the subject is realistically interacting and performing natural upper limb movements. We did not observe any significant difference in the VHI in terms of ownership and agency between the active and passive conditions, but we observed that a physically incongruent simulated interaction with the virtual world can lead to a significant disruption of ownership. Moreover, in the passive agency condition, a plausible physical behavior of the virtual hand was sufficient to elicit a partially complete sense of ownership, if measured in terms of proprioceptive drift, even in the presence of an asynchronous visuotactile sensory feedback. All these findings suggest that the multisensory feedback associated with a subject's own actions and the physical plausibility of the environment both act as determinant factors, influencing and modulating the vividness of the VHI. © 2014 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology."

In this paper, we derive a multiscale model to represent natural images based on the scale-space representation: a model that has an inspiration in the human visual system. We first derive the one-dimensional case and then extend the results to two and three dimensions. The operators obtained for analysis and synthesis stages are derivatives of the Gaussian smoothing kernel, so that, for the two-dimensional case, we can represent them either in a rotated coordinate system or in terms of directional derivatives. The method to perform the rotation is efficient because it is implemented by means of the application of the so-called generalized binomial filters. Such a family of discrete sequences fulfills a number of properties that allows estimating the local orientation for several image structures. We also define the discrete counterpart in which the coordinate normalization of the continuous case is approximated as a subsampling of the discrete domain. © 2006 IEEE."

Interaction of this protein with phospho-CheY (CheY-P) through its N terminus constitutes the main information relay point between the chemotactic system and the flagellum. In this work, we evaluated the role of the N terminus of FliM in the swimming behavior of Rhodobacter sphaeroides. Strains expressing the FliM protein with substitutions in residues previously reported in Escherichia coli as being important for interaction with CheY showed an increased stop frequency compared with wild-type cells. In accordance, we observed that R. sphaeroides cells expressing FliM lacking either the first 13 or 20 amino acids from the N terminus showed a stopped phenotype. We show evidence that FliMΔ13 and FliMΔ20 are stable proteins and that cells expressing them allow flagellin export at levels indistinguishable from those detected for the wild-type strain. These results suggest that the N-terminal region of FliM is required to promote swimming in this bacterium. The role of CheY in controlling flagellar rotation in this organism is discussed."

Instead, monitoring an important class of properties, requiring processes to produce at most k different values does require such a large number of opinions. Specifically, our main result is a proof that it is impossible to monitor k-set-agreement in an n-process system with fewer than min {2k,n} + 1 opinions. We also provide an algorithm to monitor k-set-agreement with min {2k,n} + 1 opinions, showing that the lower bound is tight."

It is known that spatial self-organisation can help with this, making autocatalytic chemical systems more robust to invasion by parasitic species. In previous work we have shown that in such scenarios parasitic reactions can actually be beneficial. Here we demonstrate for the first time a system in which the presence of a parasitic autocatalytic cycle is not only beneficial but actually necessary for the persistence of its host. This occurs due to the effect the parasite has on the spatial organisation of the system; the host-parasite system is more stable than the host alone, despite the fact that the parasite s direct effect on its host is purely negative.

We remain skeptical about solutions based on deep neural networks and cognitive robotics, which in our opinion do not fundamentally address the problem. We agree with the enactive approach to cognitive science that things appear as intrinsically meaningful for living beings because of their precarious existence as adaptive autopoietic individuals. But this approach inherits the problem of failing to account for how meaning as such could make a difference for an agent's behavior. In a nutshell, if life and mind are identified with physically deterministic phenomena, then there is no conceptual room for meaning to play a role in its own right. We argue that this impotence of meaning can be addressed by revising the concept of nature such that the macroscopic scale of the living can be characterized by physical indeterminacy. We consider the implications of this revision of the mind-body relationship for synthetic approaches."

A quantitative measure of domain promiscuity, the weighted domain architecture score (WDAS), was used and applied to 1317 domains in 1320 genomes of Bacteria and Archaea. A functional analysis associated with the WDAS per genome showed that 18 of 50 functional categories were identified as significantly enriched in the promiscuous domains; in particular, small-molecule binding domains, transferases domains, DNA binding domains (transcription factors), and signal transduction domains were identified as promiscuous. In contrast, non-promiscuous domains were identified as associated with 6 of 50 functional categories, and the category Function unknown was enriched.

A quantitative measure of domain promiscuity, the weighted domain architecture score (WDAS), was used and applied to 1317 domains in 1320 genomes of Bacteria and Archaea. A functional analysis associated with the WDAS per genome showed that 18 of 50 functional categories were identified as significantly enriched in the promiscuous domains; in particular, small-molecule binding domains, transferases domains, DNA binding domains (transcription factors), and signal transduction domains were identified as promiscuous. In contrast, non-promiscuous domains were identified as associated with 6 of 50 functional categories, and the category Function unknown was enriched. In addition, the WDASs of 52 domains correlated with genome size, i.e., WDAS values decreased as the genome size increased, suggesting that the number of combinations at larger domains increases, including domains in the superfamilies Winged helix-turn-helix and P-loop-containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolases.

This publicly available information was used to infer the regulatory network that controls the differentiation of T lymphocytes into CD4+ and CD8+ cells. Hereby we present a network that consists of 50 nodes and 97 regulatory interactions, representing the main signaling circuits established among molecules and molecular complexes regulating the differentiation of T cells. The network was converted into a continuous dynamical system in the form of a set of coupled ordinary differential equations, and its dynamical behavior was studied. With the aid of numerical methods, nine fixed point attractors were found for the dynamical system. These attractors correspond to the activation patterns observed experimentally for the following cell types: CD4-CD8-, CD4+CD8+, CD4+ naive, Th1, Th2, Th17, Treg, CD8+ naive, and CTL. Furthermore, the model is able to describe the differentiation process from the precursor CD4-CD8- to any of the effector types due to a specific series of extracellular signals. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd."

The Blackboard pattern is an architectural pattern useful for problems for which no deterministic solution strategies are known. Several specialized subsystems or components ""assemble"" their knowledge to build a possibly partial or approximate solution, coordinated by a central controller. On the other hand, the Shared Resource pattern is a specialization of the Blackboard pattern, in which subsystems or components are allowed to perform simultaneous computations without a prescribed order on different, ordered data. The Secure Blackboard pattern includes ways to add security at the control component, providing secure handling of data, as well as controlling data transformation and movement."

Describing structures at different scales as goal-oriented agents, one can define sigma is an element of [0, 1] (satisfaction) as the degree to which the goals of each agent at each scale have been met. sigma reflects the organization degree at that scale. The sigma profile of a system shows the satisfaction at different scales, with the possibility to study their dependencies and evolution. It can also be used to extend game theoretic models. The description of a general tendency on the evolution of complexity and cooperation naturally follows from the sigma profile. Experiments on a virtual ecosystem are used as illustration.

However, coordination is often needed to “break the symmetry” of processes that are initially in the same state, for example, to get exclusive access to a shared resource, to get distinct names or to elect a leader. This paper introduces and studies the family of generalized symmetry breaking (GSB) tasks, that includes election, renaming and many other symmetry breaking tasks. Differently from agreement tasks, a GSB task is “inputless”, in the sense that processes do not propose values; the task only specifies the symmetry breaking requirement, independently of the system’s initial state (where processes differ only on their identifiers). Among various results characterizing the family of GSB tasks, it is shown that (non adaptive) perfect renaming is universal for all GSB tasks."

This approach presents the advantage of using several strategies for feature extraction. and classification to achieve pattern recognition based upon, linear or nonlinear strategies. For instance, Principal Component Analysis, wavelets, time frequency distributions and partial model-build parameters (like ARMAX) are techniques feasible to extract, key characteristics from data either in terms of time series or clusters. However, these may not be suitable for every data analysis in terms of unknown scenarios; therefore it, is necessary to combine some of there, to achieve a valid classification. In that, respect, the use of non supervised neural networks Like ARTMAP or SOM as powerful classifiers to organize the data in accurate terms as post-processing techniques becomes suitable in specific cases, where, the most common characteristics to be found in, data are hard nonlinearities and a great variation of frequencies. Based upon, these two issues, two strategies are followed; ARMAX (for pre- processing the data) and SOM (for pos-processing the data) both have been chosen in terms of partial linear model representation and the related classification, where, some important, restrictions are the related to inherent, online characteristics and time variances. This novel strategy is validated by using a heuristic proposal of error measure which is studied and implemented in order to determine the most suitable parameters for this sort of combination front both algorithms. An important issue to be taken into account, is sampling to avoid quantization at fault, diagnosis algorithm. A benchmark example with two typical faults is reviewed and implemented in order to highlight the benefits of this novel strategy. Results of this evaluation are presented in terms of several simulated experiments considering fault, and fault-free scenarios."

Learning helps to improve the robots navigation performance by finding navigation landmarks which guide the mobile robot from an origin to a destination. There are several algorithms that find the best path or a path given an origin, a destination and a symbolic representation of the environment, one way to find a solution is by using genetic algorithms (GA). In our approach each chromosome is represented by a set of points, that represents landmarks, that the robot needs to follow from an origin to a destination.

Our objective was to prove that GA is a good option as a method for finding landmarks for mobile robots’ navigation"

The Human/Robot Interface subsystem consists of tree modules: Natural Language Understanding, Speech Generation and Robot’s Facial Expressions. To demonstrate the utility of this Human-Robot interaction subsystem it is presented a set of applications that allows a user to command a mobile robot through spoken commands. The mobile robot accomplish the required commands using an actions planner and reactive behaviors. In the ViRbot architecture the actions planner module uses Conceptual Dependency (CD) primitives as the base for representing the problem domain. After a command is spoken a CD representation of it is generated, a rule base system takes this CD representation, and using the state of the environment generates other subtasks represented by CDs to accomplish the command. In this paper is also presented how to represent context through scripts. Using scripts it is easy to make inferences about events for which there are incomplete information or are ambiguous. Scripts serve to encode common sense knowledge. Scripts are also used to fill the gaps between seemingly unrelated events."

The authors have already reported experimental considerations of the behaviour of n-ary Relational, Binary-Relational, Associative and Transrelational models within the context of Data Warehousing [1], [2], [3] to address issues of storage efficiency and combinatorial explosion through data repetition. In this paper we present the results obtained during the industrial usage of Binary-Relational model based DBMS within a reference architectural configuration. These industrial results are similar to the ones obtained during the experimental stage of this research at the University laboratory [4] where improvements on query speed, data load and considerable reductions on disk space are achieved. These industrial tests considered a wide set of industries: Manufacturing, Government, Retail, Telecommunications and Finance."

The concentration on a few selected sites gives better consistency and accuracy than collecting smaller amounts from a larger number of sites. 23 frequencies were detected with a high statistical significance. 6 of these are new. The 17 frequencies found in common with the 1992–1995 data are the modes with highest amplitudes. This indicates that the pulsation spectrum of FG Vir is relatively stable over the ten-year period. Two frequencies have variable amplitudes and phases from year to year as well as during 2002. These were both found to be double modes with close frequencies. For the mode at 12.15 c/d this leads to an apparent modulation with a time scale of ~129 d. The close frequencies at 12.15 c/d are composed of a radial and a nonradial mode, suggesting a similarity with the Blazhko Effect seen in RR Lyrae stars."

TEGA is a combination of a high temperature furnace and a mass spectrometer (MS) that was used to analyze samples delivered to the instrument via a robotic arm. The samples were heated at a programmed ramp rate up to 1000 °C. The power required for heating can be carefully and continuously monitored (scanning calorimetry). The evolved gases generated during the process can be analyzed with the evolved gas analyzer (a magnetic sector mass spectrometer) in order to determine the composition of gases released as a function of temperature. Our laboratory has developed a sample characterization method using a pyrolyzer integrated to a quadrupole mass spectrometer to support the interpretations of TEGA data. Here we examine the evolved gas properties of six types of hyperarid soils from the Pampas de La Joya in southern Peru (a possible analog to Mars), to which we have added with microorganisms (Salmonella typhimurium, Micrococcus luteus, and Candida albicans) in order to investigate the effect of the soil matrix on the TEGA response. Between 20 and 40 mg of soil, with or without ∼5 mg of lyophilized microorganism biomass (dry weight), were placed in the pyrolyzer and heated from room temperature to 1200 °C in 1 h at a heating rate of 20 °C/min. The volatiles released were transferred to a MS using helium as a carrier gas. The quadrupole MS was ran in scan mode from 10 to 200 m/z. In addition, ∼20 mg of each microorganism without a soil matrix were analyzed. As expected, there were significant differences in the gases released from microorganism samples with or without a soil matrix, under similar heating conditions. Furthermore, samples from the most arid environments had significant differences compared with less arid soils. Organic carbon released in the form of CO 2 (ion 44 m/z) from microorganisms evolved at temperatures of ∼326.0 ± 19.5 °C, showing characteristic patterns for each one. Others ions such as 41, 78 and 91 m/z were also found. Interestingly, during the thermal process, the release of CO 2 increased and ions previously found disappeared, demonstrating a high-oxidant activity in the soil matrix when it was subjected to high temperature. Finally, samples of soil show CO 2 evolved up to 650 °C consistent with thermal decomposition of carbonates. These results indicate that organics mixed with these hyperarid soils are oxidized to CO 2 . Our results suggest the existence of at least two types of oxidants in these soils, a thermolabile oxidant which is highly oxidative and other thermostable oxidant which has a minor oxidative activity and that survives the heat-treatment. Furthermore, we find that the interaction of biomass added to soil samples gives a different set of breakdown gases than organics resident in the soil. The nature of oxidant(s) present in the soils from Pampas de La Joya is still unknown. © 2009 COSPAR."

The problem is addressed by using well known computer vision techniques which consider: 1) The recovery of camera-eyeball model parameters by an auto-calibration method. The camera parameters are found via the solution of simplified Kruppa equations, based on correspondences found by a LMedS optimisation correlation between pairs of eight different views. 2) The extraction of blood vessels and skeletons from two fundus images. 3) The matching of corresponding points of the two skeleton trees. The trees are previously labelled during the analysis of 2D binary images. Finally, 4) the lineal triangulation of matched correspondence points and the surface modelling via generalised cylinders using diameter measurements extracted from the 2D binary images.

Rat spleen was serially cut and sections were contrasted with procedures preferential for DNA. Electron microscopy images were digitized, processed, and displayed using a commercial software package, complemented by a system for three-dimensional reconstruction and analysis developed by us on an IBM-compatible microcomputer provided with an image acquisition board. The reconstructions showed a continuous layer of compact chromatin in contact with the nuclear envelope that prevents the automatic recognition of individual chromatin clumps. The ensemble of the arrangement of compact chromatin was found to be very similar in different lymphocytes. After morphological filtering procedures, the initial mass was divided into individual bodies of compact chromatin, which were tagged. Most of these bodies contact the nuclear envelope. The number of bodies as well as the number of contacts with the envelope are similar and correspond to a haploid number of chromosomes. The largest body is always the one containing nucleolus-associated chromatin. When the cell has two nucleoli, the nucleolus-associated chromatin bodies contact the envelope in diametrically opposed areas. This feature was also described in rat liver cells. It is concluded that: (a) the individualized compact chromatin bodies do not correspond to an entire chromosome or to a pair of chromosomes; (b) the arrangement of compact chromatin is not identical in each G0 lymphocyte, but there are patterns that are repeated with limited changes; and (c) there are common features that appear in different cell types of individuals of the same species."

We show that the optimal positioning of the guards can be determined in linear time. We extend the result by proving that in an arbitrary orthogonal art gallery (not necessarily convex, possibly having holes) with n rectangular rooms and k walls, ⌈(n + k)/2⌋ guards are always sufficient and occasionally necessary to guard all the rooms in our gallery. A linear time algorithm to find the positioning of the guards is obtained."

For this purpose, NT-containing terminals were labeled by immunohistochemistry, and ganglion cells were detected by retrograde labeling of cardiac and vertebral nerves to identify cardiac and noncardiac neurons. To determine a possible regional localization of NTIR terminals and ganglion cells, the ganglia were divided into four areas: caudal, dorsomedial, cranial, and ventromedial, related to the two major afferent nerves (thoracic white rami 3 [T3WR] and 2 [T2WR]) and the two efferent nerves (vertebral and cardiac). NTIR terminals were widespread in the complete ganglion tissue; they covered practically all the regions explored, although two clusters of high concentration of NTIR terminals were detected in the cranial and caudal areas. By retrograde labeling it was found that cardiac cells were arranged around the exit of the cardiac nerve and that the vertebral neurons were extended from the exit of the vertebral nerve to the entrance of T3WR. The finding of association of NTIR terminals with cardiac neurons may account for the cardioregulatory effect of NT; however, since the presence of NTIR terminals close to the noncardiac neurons is notorious, other regulatory functions of NT must be considered."

Yet both of these approaches are in implicit agreement that the first forms of life were basically passive. That shared assumption has begun to be challenged by a new generation of metabolism-first approaches, emphasizing that movement and adaptive behavior could have played an important role right from the start. After introducing recent research on this behavior-based approach to the origin of life, I offer a preliminary assessment of what this new approach implies for the origins of the genetic system."

Sampling the content of an Online Social Network (OSN) plays an important role as a knowledge discovery tool. It is becoming increasingly difficult to ignore the fact that current sampling methods must cope with a lack of a full sampling frame i.e., there is an imposed condition determined by a limited data access. In addition, another key aspect to take into account is the huge amount of data generated by users of social networking services such as Twitter, which is perhaps the most influential microblogging service producing approximately 500 million tweets per day. In this context, due to the size of Twitter, which is problematic to be measured, the analysis of the entire network is infeasible and sampling is unavoidable. In addition, we strongly believe that there is a clear need to develop a new methodology to collect information on social networks (social mining). In this regard, we think that this paper introduces a set of random strategies that could be considered as a reliable alternative to gather global trends on Twitter. It is important to note that this research pretends to show some initial ideas in how convenient are random walks to extract information or global trends. The main purpose of this study, is to propose a suitable methodology to carry out an efficient collecting process via three random strategies: Brownian, Illusion and Reservoir. These random strategies will be applied through a Metropolis-Hastings Random Walk (MHRW). We show that interesting insights can be obtained by sampling emerging global trends on Twitter. The study also offers some important insights providing descriptive statistics and graphical description from the preliminary experiments."

The lack of a comprehensive collection of information on the Crl regulon makes it difficult to identify a dominant function of Crl and to generate any hypotheses concerning its taxonomical distribution in archaeal and bacterial organisms. Results: In this work, based on a systematic literature review, we identified the first comprehensive dataset of 86 genes under the control of Crl in the bacterium Escherichia coli K-12; those genes correspond to 40% of the σ S regulon in this bacterium. Based on an analysis of orthologs in 18 archaeal and 69 bacterial taxonomical divisions and using E. coli K-12 as a framework, we suggest three main events that resulted in this regulon's actual form: (i) in a first step, rpoS, a gene widely distributed in bacteria and archaea cellular domains, was recruited to regulate genes involved in ancient metabolic processes, such as those associated with glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle; (ii) in a second step, the regulon recruited those genes involved in metabolic processes, which are mainly taxonomically constrained to Proteobacteria, with some secondary losses, such as those genes involved in responses to stress or starvation and cell adhesion, among others; and (iii) in a posterior step, Crl might have been recruited in Enterobacteriaceae; because its taxonomical pattern constrained to this bacterial order, however further analysis are necessary. Conclusions: Therefore, we suggest that the regulon Crl is highly flexible for phenotypic adaptation, probably as consequence of the diverse growth environments associated with all organisms in which members of this regulatory network are present. © 2019 The Author(s)."

Recently, it has been proven that this type of neurons can be applied to solve pattern recognition problems with great efficiency. However, the lack of learning strategies for training these models do not allow to use them in several pattern recognition problems. On the other hand, several bioinspired algorithms have been proposed in the last years for solving a broad range of optimization problems, including those related to the field of artificial neural networks (ANNs). Artificial bee colony (ABC) is a novel algorithm based on the behavior of bees in the task of exploring their environment to find a food source. In this paper, we describe how the ABC algorithm can be used as a learning strategy to train a spiking neuron aiming to solve pattern recognition problems. Finally, the proposed approach is tested on several pattern recognition problems. It is important to remark that to realize the powerfulness of this type of model only one neuron will be used. In addition, we analyze how the performance of these models is improved using this kind of learning strategy. © 2015 Roberto A. Vazquez and Beatriz A. Garro."

Additionally an in-house code was developed to evaluate this core under steady state and transient conditions including a stability analysis. The code has two modules: (a) the time domain module for transient analysis and (b) the frequency domain module for stability analysis. The thermal-hydraulic process is modeled by a set of five equations, considering no homogeneous flow with drift-flux approximation and non-equilibrium thermodynamic. The neutronic process is calculated with a point kinetics model. Typical BWR reactivity effects are considered: void fraction, fuel temperature, moderator temperature and control rod density. Collapsed parameters were included in the code to represent the core using an average fuel channel. For the stability analysis, in the frequency domain, the transfer function is determined by applying Laplace-transforming to the calculated pressure drop perturbations in each of the considered regions where a constant total pressure drop was considered. The transfer function was used to study the system response in the frequency domain when an inlet flow perturbation is applied. The results show that the neutronic behavior of the core with thorium uranium fuel is similar to a UO2 core, even during transient conditions. The stability and transient analysis show that the thorium-uranium fuel can be operated safely in current BWRs. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

There are situations, mainly in high permeability reservoirs, where the maximum pressure variation is of the order of one thousandth of the total scale of the probe. Noise greater than one thousandth of the total pressure change hides pressure signals related to the characteristics of the reservoir; even when the accuracy of the tool could achieve one part by million of the total scale. This situation makes almost impossible the interpretation with the logarithmic derivative. It is demonstrated in this paper that the frequency spectrum of noise is in the same frequency band that frequencies associated to the reservoir signal. By using a fitting procedure and wavelets, the signal-noise ratio (SNR) of pressure tests with truncation noise is improved in most of the cases up to 8 dB. This situation is equivalent to measure the maximum pressure change of the reservoir with a tool of one bit of additional effective resolution. Greater improvements can be obtained when only Gaussian white noise is present in the pressure signal. This result offers the possibility to reuse old noisy derivative data logs, especially pressure tests from high permeability reservoirs. This contribution will permit to utilize derivative interpretation techniques in a more appropriate way. The efficiency of the proposed filtering technique is demonstrated with synthetic and field data pressure tests."

And in turn the worldwide prevalence of these types of hallucinations has been explained by appealing to humanity's shared neurobiological embodiment. Moreover, it has been proposed that neural network activity can exhibit similar types of spatiotemporal patterns, especially those caused by Turing instabilities under disinhibited, non-ordinary conditions. Altered states of consciousness thus provide a suitable pivot point from which to investigate the complex relationships between symbolic material culture, first-person experience, and neurobiology. We critique prominent theories of these relationships. Drawing inspiration from neurophenomenology, we sketch the beginnings of an alternative, enactive approach centered on the concepts of sense-making, value, and sensorimotor decoupling."

Considering the steady state parameter Z eq which characterizes the subset of two indistinguishable leaks, a family of dynamic models with constraints is obtained. This family, called F, allows to reformulate in a simple way the leaks identification task in which diverse off-line optimization algorithms can be used to solve it. The formulation of the optimization task with constraints is the main contribution of this work. The advantages of the family F in term of the search interval reduction are discussed using the parameters of a water pilot pipeline of 135m long in which the L 2 norm of the upstream flow error is minimized using real data."

According to the fetal position and the stage of development of the fetal skull, a specific plane of image acquisition is required. In most cases for a single plane of acquisition, the image quality is limited by the shadows produced by the skull. In this work a new method for registration of multiple views of 3D ultrasound of the fetal brain is reported, which results in improved imaging of the internal brain structures. In the initial stage, texture, intensity and edge features are used, with a support vector machine (SVM) for the segmentation of the skull in each of the 3D ultrasound views to be registered. The segmentation of each skull is modelled as a set of points with the centre determined with a Gaussian mixture model, where each point is assigned a probability of membership to a Gaussian determined by the posterior probability assigned by the SVM. Our method has shown improved results compared to intensity based registration, with a 52% reduction in the target registration error (TRE), and a 39% reduction in the TRE compared to feature based registration. These are encouraging results for the future development of an automatic method for registration and fusion of multiple views of 3D fetal ultrasound."

Indeed, the search for lower bounds and impossibility results for this problem spawned the topological approach to distributed computing, which has given rise to new techniques in the design and analysis of protocols. The design of efficient solutions to set consensus has also proven to be challenging. In the synchronous crash failure model, the literature contains a sequence of solutions to set consensus, each improving upon the previous ones. This paper presents an unbeatable protocol for nonuniform k-set consensus in the synchronous crash failure model. This is an efficient protocol whose decision times cannot be improved upon. Moreover, the description of our protocol is extremely succinct. Proving unbeatability of this protocol is a nontrivial challenge. We provide two proofs for its unbeatability: one is a subtle constructive combinatorial proof, and the other is a topological proof of a new style. These two proofs provide new insight into the connection between topological reasoning and combinatorial reasoning about protocols, which has long been a subject of interest. In particular, our topological proof reasons in a novel way about subcomplexes of the protocol complex, and sheds light on an open question posed by Guerraoui and Pochon (2009). Finally, using the machinery developed in the design of this unbeatable protocol, we propose a protocol for uniform k-set consensus that beats all known solutions by a large margin."

In Part 1, we derived both microscopic and coarse-grained evolution equations for strings and schemata for a selecto-recombinative GA using generalised recombination, and we explained the hierarchical nature of the schema evolution equations. In this part, we provide a variety of fixed points for evolution in the case where recombination is used alone, thereby generalising Geiringer's theorem. In addition, we numerically integrate the infinite-population schema equations for some interesting problems, where selection and recombination are used together to illustrate how these operators interact. Finally, to assess by how much genetic drift can make a system deviate from the infinite-population-model predictions we discuss the results of real GA runs for the same model problems with generalised recombination, selection and finite populations of different sizes."

Models of these processes have contributed to understand excitability self-sustained oscillations and synchronization in arrays of oscillators. Integrate-and-fire (I+F) models are popular minimal fill-and-flush mathematical models. They are used in neuroscience to study spiking and phase locking in single neuron membranes, large scale neural networks, and in a variety of applications in physics and electrical engineering. We show here how the classical first-order I+F model fits into the theory of nonlinear oscillators of van der Pol type by demonstrating that a particular second-order oscillator having small parameters converges in a singular perturbation limit to the I+F model. In this sense, our study provides a novel unfolding of such models and it identifies a constructible electronic circuit that is closely related to I+F. © 2009 Springer-Verlag."

In this paper we assume that the time of message transmission is positive but negligible. It is shown that the synchronizer is sufficient to assure that a full rate of computation is achieved in networks with a global clock, in spite of the absence of a global start-up signal. In fact, unison is reached within linear time. A similar phenomenon occurs if there is no global clock, but all local clocks have the same rate. In case the local clocks do not have the same rate, it is shown that the computational rate is not slower than any sluggish clock; i.e., a clock such that between any two of its ticks, every local clock ticks at least once"

This self-optimization process has been replicated in various neural network formalisms, but it is still unclear whether it can be applied to biologically more realistic network topologies and scaled up to larger networks. Here we continue our efforts to respond to these challenges by demonstrating the process on the connectome of the widely studied nematode worm C. elegans. We extend our previous work by considering the contributions made by hierarchical partitions of the connectome that form functional clusters, and we explore possible beneficial effects of inter-cluster inhibitory connections. We conclude that the self-optimization process can be applied to neural network topologies characterized by greater biological realism, and that long-range inhibitory connections can facilitate the generalization capacity of the process."

Using robust estimators and relaxation labelling techniques, an unsupervised segmentation algorithm was developed. The mean gray value of each region is estimated from the histogram using robust clustering analysis. The gray level distribution of each individual region is approximated through the mean gray value cooccurrence data. The standard deviation of the gray levels of each region is estimated from this distribution using the least median of squares (LMedS) robust estimator. The labelling of the pixels is done through an iterative relaxation region growing process, taking into account both spectral and spatial information. The method is tested in various images and validated with synthetic data, where it is shown that the known true parameters are recovered accurately."

A more structured model is the iterated immediate snapshot model (IIS), where processes execute communication closed rounds. In each round, they communicate using read/write registers that cannot be reused in later rounds. It is known that a task is solvable in the IIS model if and only if it is solvable in the basic read/write model. Both models are also equivalent when, in addition to read/write registers, processes also have access to stronger communication objects called 01-tasks. This paper extends further the task computability equivalence presenting a simulation that includes x-consensus objects, which solve consensus among up to x processes.

Urban migration to and from cities is characterised as non-random and following non-random pathways. Cities are multidimensional non-linear phenomena, so understanding the relationships and connectivity between scales is important in determining how the interplay of local/regional urban policies may affect the distribution of urban settlements. In order to quantify these relationships, we follow an information theoretic approach using the concept of Transfer Entropy. Our analysis is based on a stochastic urban fractal model, which mimics urban growing settlements and migration waves. The results indicate how different policies could affect urban morphology in terms of the information generated across geographical scales."

Data collected by mobile sensors are typically sent to a central server in order to be shared with other users through cellular or WiFi networks. Unfortunately, the cost of deploying and maintaining such infrastructure may be prohibitively high. Furthermore, a disaster situation on the server side may cause the failure of the whole system. As an alternative approach, in this work we introduce Urbihoc, a data acquisition method that uses opportunistic transmissions to directly share data among mobile nodes. In this way, from local exchanges, Urbihoc builds up global knowledge about a monitored phenomenon. Our results suggest that, in some applications, it is possible to monitor a phenomenon over a large metropolitan area by using only the resources contributed by mobile users."

Use of it can be made to explain the behavior of materials on different stress situation, if five viscoelastics constants [2] obtained from creep tests, are determined. Once the constants are found through electronic processing of data, the model can be used to explain the behavior of the material in a common torsion test, to obtain stress-strain diagrams or any other stress situation. As on example, creep data on cement mortars, obtained on a carefully controlled experimental setup are analysed and processed, to obtain the viscoelastic constants; with these values, stress-strain diagrams are obtained for cement mortar and compared with experimental data. © 1969 Secrétariat de Rédaction."

20484,Use of genetic programming in the identification of rational model structures,2000,Katya Rodríguez Vázquez,Instituto de Investigaciones en Matemáticas Aplicadas y en Sistemas (IIMAS),,3-540-67339-3,0302-9743,,,IA,Genetic and Evolutionary Computation,ALGORITHM; SYSTEMS,"This paper demonstrates how genetic programming can be used for solving problems in the field of non-linear system identification of rational models. By using a two-tree structure rather than introducing the division operator in the function set, this genetic programming approach is able to determine the true model structure of the system under investigation. However, unlike use of the polynomial, which is linear in the parameters, use of rational model is non-linear in the parameters and thus noise terms cannot be estimated properly. By means of a second optimisation process (real-coded GA) which has the aim of running the coefficients to the true values, these parameters are then correctly computed. This approach is based upon the well-known NARMAX model representation, widely used in non-linear system identification."

It identifies a class of acceptable conditions on the set of input vectors that, when satisfied by the actual input vector, are exactly the conditions that allow to solve consensus despite up to t faulty processes. This paper investigates the use of conditions to solve consensus in synchronous systems prone to process crash failures. It first shows that for any acceptable condition there is a condition-based protocol solving uniform consensus that enjoys the following property: when the input vector belongs to the condition, it terminates in a single round if no process crashes, and in two rounds otherwise. When the input vector does not belong to the condition, the actual number of rounds is upper bounded by t + 1 (it actually depends on both the crash pattern and the input vector). The paper then extends the previous protocol to combine early decision with the condition-based approach. It presents a general protocol that enjoys the previous properties (decision in one or two rounds) when the input vector belongs to the condition and terminates in at most min(t + 1, f + 2) rounds when the input vector does not belong to the condition (where f is the actual number of faulty processes). Finally, the paper presents corresponding matching lower bounds. It shows that acceptable conditions are the only ones for which a consensus protocol can enjoy the previous properties."

20507,Using Finite-State Methods for Getting Infinite Languages: A Preview,2009,Gemma Bel Enguix,Instituto de Ingeniería (II),,,1453-8245,,,IA,Linguistics,TRANSDUCERS; COLONIES; SYSTEMS,"In this paper, a new/alternative approach to language representation is presented. In our model, languages are formed by interactions of a finite number of grammars each of them generating just a finite language. We consider languages as infinite objects which emerge from interactions of 'smaller' finite language generators. The approach we introduce here can build a bridge between two opposite views in present-day linguistics-one that regards natural languages as infinite objects, and the second one that regards them as finite objects. The basic notion we used here is called a colony. Colonies as well-formalized language generating devices were proposed in [33]. Components of a colony are regular grammars generating finite languages and operating on a shared string of symbols. The aim of this contribution is to connect both colonies and the philosophy behind them with the opposition between two conceptions of natural language: the work in theoretical linguistics, where many scholars agree that the set of sentences in a human language must be denumerably infinite, and the work in corpus-based computational linguistics, where the focus is often on language as a finite set. We intend to show that it is possible to formally reconcile these two so apparently different conceptions of natural language."

This shift from cognitive science to consciousness science presents a profound challenge to synthetic approaches. To be sure, symbolic artificial intelligence constituted the original foundation of cognitive science; subsequent progress in robotics has helped to pioneer a new understanding of the mind as essentially embodied, situated, and dynamical, while artificial life has informed the concept of biological self-organization. However, with regard to the development of a science of the experienced mind, the relevance of these synthetic approaches still remains uncertain. We propose to address the challenge of first-person experience by designing new human–computer interfaces, which aim to artificially mediate a participant’s sensorimotor loop such that novel kinds of experience can emerge for the user. The advantage of this synthetic approach is that computer interface technology enables us to systematically vary the ways in which participants experience the world and thereby allows us to systematically investigate ‘mind-as-it-could-be’ from the first-person perspective. We illustrate the basic principles of this method by drawing on examples from our research in sensory substitution, virtual reality, and interactive installation."

Learning how to engage via a human-computer interface (HCI) can therefore be taken as an instance of developing a new mode of experiencing. Similarly, social perception is theorized to be primarily constituted by skillful engagement between people, which implies that it is possible to investigate the origins and development of social awareness using multi-user HCIs. We analyzed the trial-by-trial objective and subjective changes in sociality that took place during a perceptual crossing experiment in which embodied interaction between pairs of adults was mediated over a minimalist haptic HCI. Since that study required participants to implicitly relearn how to mutually engage so as to perceive each other's presence, we hypothesized that there would be indications that the initial developmental stages of social awareness were recapitulated. Preliminary results reveal that, despite the lack of explicit feedback about task performance, there was a trend for the clarity of social awareness to increase over time. We discuss the methodological challenges involved in evaluating whether this trend was characterized by distinct developmental stages of objective behavior and subjective experience."

These adjectives introduce a set of specialized features according to a categorization proper to a particular knowledge domain. For detecting these sequences of hypernyms associated to relational adjectives, we perform a set of linguistic heuristics for recognizing such adjectives from others (e.g. psychological/ugly disorder). In our case, we applied linguistic heuristics for identifying such sequences from medical texts in Spanish. The use of these heuristics allows a trade-off between precision & recall, which is an important advance that complements other works."

By integrating a robust skeletonization technique with 3D chain coding, the proposed algorithm can compare not only the skeleton topology but also the curvature of skeleton segments. Robustness of the search and potential for retrieving similar objects is studied and shown to be better than graph-based matching. The contributions of our work include generating connected and unit-width skeletons using valence normalization; improving the performance of 3D chain codes for similarity match; and skeleton matching through chain expressions. The advantage of our method lies in its ability to distinguish between relatively similar objects and different poses of similar objects.

The present study was set up to test whether laboratory toxicity data and the combined concepts of metal availability and mixture toxicity can predict ecological impact in mining-affected soils. Metal and As contamination gradients were sampled approximately 5 different mines in Mexico where plant cover and abundances exhibited clear dose-related responses. Soils were analyzed for total and isotopically exchangeable (labile) concentrations of Ni, Cu, Cd, Pb, and As and for soil properties affecting the availability of these elements. Six different indices of toxic doses were compared to evaluate their accuracy in describing the field response expressed as relative abundance and cover. Each index was based on a different method to calculate the sum of toxic units ((Formula presented.) TUs) in soil, with 1 toxic unit equal to the concentration of the element in soil yielding 50% adverse effect on plants with median sensitivity as recorded in a recent database of salt-spiked soils. Toxic concentrations in the mine-impacted soils were dominated by Zn and As. In the field, 50% reduced cover or abundance was found at 10 to 13 (Formula presented.) TUs if these were based on total soil concentrations and thresholds derived from freshly spiked soils, indicating a largely overestimated toxic effect. If thresholds were corrected for differences in availability among freshly spiked soils and spiked and laboratory-aged soils, the overestimation of field toxicity was 5- to 6-fold, irrespective of the consideration of soil properties. Finally, the (Formula presented.) TU calculated only with labile metals and As overestimated the field toxicity by factors 1.1 to 1.6 (95% confidence interval 1–7; i.e., rather accurate and indicating some Zn–As antagonism as confirmed in experimental studies). That latter index of dose yielded a bell-shaped response on species richness peaking at approximately 1.6 (Formula presented.) TU. Overall, the present study shows that the current toxicity databases of metals can predict the impact of metal contamination on plant communities within factor 2, expressing the dose as soil-labile concentrations and using the concentration addition concept in these mixed polluted environments.

These criteria quantify sensorial distortion between vectors that represent either portions of a digital image or alternatively, coefficients of a transform-based coding system. In the latter case, we use an image representation model, namely the Hermite transform, that is based on some of the main perceptual characteristics of the human vision system (HVS) and in their response to light stimulus. Energy coding in the brightness domain, determination of local structure, code-book training and local orientation analysis are all obtained by means of the Hermite transform. This paper, for thematic reasons, is divided in four sections. The first one will shortly highlight the importance of having newer and better compression algorithms. This section will also serve to explain briefly the most relevant characteristics of the HVS, advantages and disadvantages related with the behavior of our vision in front of ocular stimulus. The second section shall go through a quick review of vector quantization techniques, focusing their performance on image treatment, as a preview for the image vector quantizer compressor actually constructed in section 5. Third chapter was chosen to concentrate the most important data gathered on brightness models. The building of this so-called brightness maps (quantification of the human perception on the visible objects reflectance), in a bi-dimensional model, will be addressed here. The Hermite transform, a special case of polynomial transforms, and its usefulness, will be treated, in an applicable discrete form, in the fourth chapter. As we have learned from previous works 1, Hermite transform has showed to be a useful and practical solution to efficiently code the energy within an image block, deciding which kind of quantization is to be used upon them (whether scalar or vector). It will also be a unique tool to structurally classify the image block within a given lattice. This particular operation intends to be one of the main contributions of this work. The fifth section will fuse the proposals derived from the study of the three main topics- addressed in the last sections- in order to propose an image compression model that takes advantage of vector quantizers inside the brightness transformed domain to determine the most important structures, finding the energy distribution inside the Hermite domain. Sixth and last section will show some results obtained while testing the coding-decoding model. The guidelines to evaluate the image compressing performance were the compression ratio, SNR and psycho-visual quality. Some conclusions derived from the research and possible unexplored paths will be shown on this section as well."

The 3D-interpretation of properties where only scarce geotechnical data is available is crucial for deriving effective and safe engineering decisions. Because of the ever-increasing cost of site investigation, it is neither practical nor economical to acquire geotechnical data at each point of interest for a complete definition of soils behavior. This situation makes it necessary to explore spatial-variability modeling alternatives that can manage limited geo-information. In this paper, a dynamic-neural procedure is developed for describing spatial relations between a set of geo-parameters easy-to-obtain. Once the network is finished, this topology is used to expand the small initial set of values into millions of computer-generated measurements. The massive database is incorporated into a Virtual Reality engine that facilitates the intuitively visual understanding of geo-information, permits to present all relevant data in a comprehensible format for decision making and provides a way to reduce very complex and diverse data sets into the essential elements without loss of data quality. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

In order to monitor dynamically water transport in soil, a compromise has to be found between water flow velocity and CT acquisition time. Furthermore, an efficient image analysis method is necessary. In this work, we followed the water transport in three dimensions by CT imaging across a double-porosity media constituted of two distinct materials, i.e. sand and porous clay spheres. The CT acquisition parameters were adjusted to the water pore velocity so that we succeeded to register the water front displacement per time range of 25 min. We also used the image subtraction method to extract water distribution evolution with time with a space resolution of 6×10−3 cm. Both time and space resolution are relatively high compared with other dynamic studies. The water content profiles showed that the clay spheres remained in their dry state during water infiltration, while the water transport only occurred in the sand matrix. These results are consistent with macroscopic experiments. The water front visualized by CT showed a non-symmetrical shape which was related to water transfer in non-equilibrium as shown by column displacement experiments."

We propose that variabilities should be separately measured from the VO2 and VCO2 averages to understand technological differences among metabolic monitors when they estimate the REE. To prove this hypothesis the mixing chamber (MC) and the breath-by-breath (BbB) techniques measured the VO2 and VCO2 averages and their variabilities. Variances and power spectrum energies in the 0-0.5 Hertz band were measured to establish technique differences in steady and non-steady state. A hybrid calorimeter with both IC techniques studied a population of 15 volunteers that underwent the clino-orthostatic maneuver in order to produce the two physiological stages. The results showed that inter-individual VO2 and VCO2 variabilities measured as variances were negligible using the MC while variabilities measured as spectral energies using the BbB underwent 71 and 56% (p &lt; 0.05), increase respectively. Additionally, the energy analysis showed an unexpected cyclic rhythm at 0.025 Hertz only during the orthostatic stage, which is new physiological information, not reported previusly. The VO2 and VCO2 inter-individual averages increased to 63 and 39% by the MC (p &lt; 0.05) and 32 and 40% using the BbB (p &lt; 0.1), respectively, without noticeable statistical differences among techniques. The conclusions are: (a) metabolic monitors should simultaneously include the MC and the BbB techniques to correctly interpret the steady or non-steady state variabilities effect in the REE estimation, (b) the MC is the appropriate technique to compute averages since it behaves as a low-pass filter that minimizes variances, (c) the BbB is the ideal technique to measure the variabilities since it can work as a high-pass filter to generate discrete time series able to accomplish spectral analysis, and (d) the new physiological information in the VO2 and VCO2 variabilities can help to understand why metabolic monitors with dissimilar IC techniques give different results in the REE estimation. © 2013 Cadena-Méndez et al."

Given a VBO, an EdT is a tree which traces the borders of the object. The vertices of the EdT correspond to the vertices of the enclosing surface where some of them have been conveniently hidden in order to get a 1D representation. The computed EdT is represented by a base-five digit chain code descriptor suitably combined by means of parentheses. The EdT notation is invariant under rotation and translation, using this notation it is possible to obtain the mirror image of any VBO with ease. The EdT notation preserves the shape of VBOs. The proposed EdT notation is a good tool for storing of VBOs. Due to their features, EdTs can be considered as a 1D alternative to skeletons for representing VBOs"

Each process starts the computation with a private input value taken from a finite set of possible inputs. After communicating with the other processes using immediate snapshots, the process must decide on a binary output value, 0 or 1. The specification of the task is the following: in an execution, if the set of input values is large enough, the processes should agree on the same output; if the set of inputs is small enough, the processes should disagree; and in-between these two cases, any output is allowed. Formally, this specification depends on two threshold parameters k and ℓ, with k < ℓ, indicating when the cardinality of the set of inputs becomes “small” or “large”, respectively. We study the solvability of this task depending on those two parameters. First, we show that the task is solvable whenever k + 2 ≤ ℓ. For the remaining cases (ℓ = k + 1), we use various combinatorial topology techniques to obtain two impossibility results: the task is unsolvable if either k ≤ n/2 or n − k is odd. The remaining cases are still open. © Éric Goubault, Marijana Lazić, Jérémy Ledent, and Sergio Rajsbaum."

One of the main challenges of this problem is that the marked images should not differ perceptually from the original images allowing a correct diagnosis and authentication. Furthermore, we also aim at obtaining watermarked images with very little numerical distortion so that computer vision tasks such as segmentation of important anatomical structures do not be impaired or affected. We propose a preliminary watermarking application in cardiac CT images based on a perceptive approach that includes a brightness model to generate a perceptive mask and identify the image regions where the watermark detection becomes a difficult task for the human eye. We propose a normalization scheme of the image in order to improve robustness against geometric attacks. We follow a spread spectrum technique to insert an alphanumeric code, such as patient's information, within the watermark. The watermark scheme is based on the Hermite transform as a bio-inspired image representation model. In order to evaluate the numerical integrity of the image data after watermarking, we perform a segmentation task based on deformable models. The segmentation technique is based on a vector-value level sets method such that, given a curve in a specific image, and subject to some constraints, the curve can evolve in order to detect objects. In order to stimulate the curve evolution we introduce simultaneously some image features like the gray level and the steered Hermite coefficients as texture descriptors. Segmentation performance was assessed by means of the Dice index and the Hausdorff distance. We tested different mark sizes and different insertion schemes on images that were later segmented either automatic or manual by physicians."

The proposed method combines the content readability afforded by invisible watermarking with the visual ownership identification afforded by visible watermarking. The HVS-imperceptibility is guaranteed thanks to a Luma Variation Tolerance (LVT) curve, which is associated with the transfer function (TF) used for HDR encoding and provides the information needed to embed an imperceptible watermark in the spatial domain. The LVT curve is based on the inaccuracies between the non-linear digital representation of the linear luminance acquired by an HDR sensor and the brightness perceived by the Human Visual System (HVS) from the linear luminance displayed on an HDR screen. The embedded watermarks remain imperceptible to the HVS as long as the TF is not altered or the normal calibration and colorimetry conditions of the HDR screen remain unchanged. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations on several HDR images encoded by two widely-used TFs confirm the strong HVS-imperceptibility capabilities of the method, as well as the robustness of the embedded watermarks to tone mapping, lossy compression, and common signal processing operations."

Porosity (crack-like) models are simulated by constructing typical elastic percolation networks with random microscopic heterogeneities in order to resemble rock media. Central and bond-bending forces (Born Hamiltonian) models are considered. For each experimental case, the elastic energy of the system is relaxed in equilibrium and then the model is excited by a pulse source in order to produce wave propagation. First, a review is presented of the well established velocity-porosity relationship from rock physics, which shows a linear trend from small porosities up to the critical porosity (percolation threshold) where the rocks fall apart. From the wave propagation analysis a general trend is observed for the attenuation of waves, from the small to the large porosity models, suggesting multiple scattering effects similar to those reported from effective-medium approximations of wave scattering due to random heterogeneities. Finally, the results are compared with those obtained from laboratory experiments on dry rocks with different porosities and different applied stress regimes."

An in depth study on wavelet- and polynomial based denoising has been performed by considering standard test images and phantom tests with moderate and high levels of Gaussian noise. Different thresholding methods have been tested and evaluated and in particular a novel sigmoidal- type thresholding method has been proposed. In real applications, noise variance estimation problem becomes crucial because most of the thresholding estimators tends to overestimate this value. A comparison with the Hermite polynomial transform (HPT) and a modification of the HPT based in detecting the position and orientation of relevant edges has been accomplished. From this study one can conclude that both wavelet-based and polynomial-based denoising methods perform better than any other nonlinear filtering method both in terms of perceptual quality and edge-preserving characteristics. ©2005 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering."

A hundred English malapropisms were gathered, each supplied with its correction candidates, i.e. word combinations with one word equal to an editing variant of the corresponding word in the malapropism. Google statistics of occurrences and co-occurrences were gathered for each malapropism and correcting candidate. The collocation components may be adjacent or separated by other words in a sentence, so statistics were accumulated for the most probable distance between them. The raw Google occurrence statistics are then recalculated to numeric values of a specially defined Semantic Compatibility Index (SCI). Heuristic rules are proposed to signal malapropisms when SCI values are lower than a predetermined threshold and to retain a few highly SCI-ranked correction candidates. Within certain limitations, the experiment gave promising results."

Large-scale synchronization of neural activity has also been proposed as the neural basis of consciousness. Intriguingly, a growing number of studies in social cognitive neuroscience reveal that phase synchronization similarly appears across brains during meaningful social interaction. Moreover, this inter-brain synchronization has been associated with subjective reports of social connectedness, engagement, and cooperativeness, as well as experiences of social cohesion and 'self-other merging'. These findings challenge the standard view of human consciousness as essentially first-person singular and private. We therefore revisit the recent controversy over the possibility of extended consciousness and argue that evidence of inter-brain synchronization in the fastest frequency bands overcomes the hitherto most convincing sceptical position. If this proposal is on the right track, our understanding of human consciousness would be profoundly transformed, and we propose a method to test this proposal experimentally. © The Author(s) 2020.

20722,What does artificial life tell US about death,2013,Carlos Gershenson García,Instituto de Investigaciones en Matemáticas Aplicadas y en Sistemas (IIMAS),Centro de Ciencias de la Complejidad,9781466638907;1466638907,,10.4018/978-1-4666-3890-7.ch003,https://arxiv.org/pdf/0906.2824.pdf,TC,Philosophy,,"This paper discusses how concepts developed within artificial life (ALife) can help demystify the notion of death. This is relevant because sooner or later we will all die; death affects us all. Studying the properties of living systems independently of their substrate, ALife describes life as a type of organization. Thus, death entails the loss of that organization. Within this perspective, different notions of death are derived from different notions of life. Also, the relationship between life and mind and the implications of death to the mind are discussed. A criterium is proposed in which the value of life depends on its uniqueness, i.e. a living system is more valuable if it is harder to replace. However, this does not imply that death in replaceable living systems is unproblematic. This is decided on whether there is harm to the system produced by death. The paper concludes with speculations about how the notion of death could be shaped in the future."

Thus, a moderate individual efficiency actually leads to a better systemic performance. The SIF effect takes place in a variety of phenomena. We review studies and examples of the SIF effect in pedestrian dynamics, vehicle traffic, traffic light control, logistics, public transport, social dynamics, ecological systems, and adaptation. Drawing on these examples, we generalize common features of the SIF effect and suggest possible future lines of research. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

EP has focused on the notion of sensorimotor invariants, according to which bodily movements play an instrumental role in perception. ECS has focused on the notion of sensorimotor contingencies, which goes beyond an instrumental role because skillfully regulated movements are claimed to play a constitutive role. We refer to these two hypotheses as instrumental agency and constitutive agency, respectively. Evidence comes from a variety of fields, including neural, behavioral, and phenomenological research, but so far with confounds that prevent an experimental distinction between these hypotheses. Here we advance the debate by proposing a novel double-participant setup that aims to isolate agency as the key variable that distinguishes bodily movement in active and passive conditions of perception. We pilot this setup with a psychological study of width discrimination using the Enactive Torch, a haptic sensory substitution device. There was no evidence favoring the stronger hypothesis of constitutive agency over instrumental agency. However, we caution that during debriefing several participants reported using cognitive strategies that did not rely on spatial perception. We conclude that this approach is a viable direction for future research, but that greater care is required to establish and confirm the desired modality of first-person experience. © Copyright © 2020 Froese and Ortiz-Garin."
20744,Where There Is Life There Is Mind: In Support of a Strong Life-Mind Continuity Thesis,2017,Tom Froese,Instituto de Investigaciones en Matemáticas Aplicadas y en Sistemas (IIMAS),Instituto de Ciencias Nucleares (ICN),,,10.3390/e19040169,,IA,Philosophy,life-mind continuity; free energy principle; radical enactivism; autopoietic enactivism;FREE-ENERGY; BRAIN,"This paper considers questions about continuity and discontinuity between life and mind. It begins by examining such questions from the perspective of the free energy principle (FEP). The FEP is becoming increasingly influential in neuroscience and cognitive science. It says that organisms act to maintain themselves in their expected biological and cognitive states, and that they can do so only by minimizing their free energy given that the long-term average of free energy is entropy. The paper then argues that there is no singular interpretation of the FEP for thinking about the relation between life and mind. Some FEP formulations express what we call an independence view of life and mind. One independence view is a cognitivist view of the FEP. It turns on information processing with semantic content, thus restricting the range of systems capable of exhibiting mentality. Other independence views exemplify what we call an overly generous non-cognitivist view of the FEP, and these appear to go in the opposite direction. That is, they imply that mentality is nearly everywhere. The paper proceeds to argue that non-cognitivist FEP, and its implications for thinking about the relation between life and mind, can be usefully constrained by key ideas in recent enactive approaches to cognitive science. We conclude that the most compelling account of the relationship between life and mind treats them as strongly continuous, and that this continuity is based on particular concepts of life (autopoiesis and adaptivity) and mind (basic and non-semantic)."

In this chapter we discuss the difficulties of distinguishing between the two. First, a suitable characterization of profit that distinguishes between trading gains and market gains is required. Secondly, one needs to be able to characterize trading strategies. To achieve this, we introduce the notion of a genotype-phenotype map to finance, where the genotype is associated with the information set and associated decision rules that lead to a given set of trading decisions for a given trader, while the phenotype is described by the set of observable trading decisions themselves. In AI based systems, such as agent-based markets, a strategy is implemented algorithmically and so the genotype is explicitly known. In real markets however, the genotypic trading strategy of one trader is hidden from the rest. The phenotype however, is, in principle, observable. A microscopic description at the level of the set of individual trades, however, is not sufficient to understand or characterize the strategies at a more macroscopic and intuitive one. By introducing a set of coarse grained variables that can be used to classify strategy types, we show how these variables can then be data mined to understand what differs between an intelligent and a lucky strategy. We show that these variables can be used to distinguish between different strategy types and can be further used to infer the presence of learning and adaptation in the market. We illustrate all of the above using data from an experimental political market."

Methodology: We present a multi-agent simulation where a default method with no restrictions always leads to unstable headways. We discuss two methods that attempt to achieve equal headways, called minimum and maximum. Since one parameter of the methods depends on the passenger density, adaptive versions-where the relevant parameter is adjusted automatically-are also put forward. Our results show that the adaptive maximum method improves significantly over the default method. The model and simulation give insights of the interplay between transport design and passenger behavior.

The results show that there is a clear increase in the rate of evolution when information on the state of the population is used to select the crossover point, compared to random selection of the crossover point."

The use of a multilayer ANN to predict wind time series in four strategic points in the two-dimensional space, together with the implementation of image recognition techniques, are explained first; afterwards the CS algorithm is applied to obtain intermediate wind series in order to complete the simulation. The effectiveness of this procedure is evaluated by comparison of its results to those reported by theory, for a specific example."

Using the autoregressive model called Time Delay Coordinates, feature selection is performed by the Phase Space Reconstruction procedure. Then, a Support Vector Regression model is trained using univariate wind speed time series. Parameters of Support Vector Regression are tuned by a genetic algorithm. The proposed method is compared against the persistence model, and autoregressive models (AR, ARMA, and ARIMA) tuned by Akaikes Information Criterion and Ordinary Least Squares method. The stationary transformation of time series is also evaluated for the proposed method. Using historical wind speed data from the Mexican Wind Energy Technology Center (CERTE) located at La Ventosa, Oaxaca, México, the accuracy of the proposed forecasting method is evaluated for a whole range of short termforecasting horizons (from 1 to 24 h ahead). Results show that, forecasts made with our method are more accurate for medium (5–23 h ahead) short term WSF and WPF than those made with persistence and autoregressive models."

Alcohol-induced liver damage is characterized by polymorphonuclear cell (PMN) infiltration, which can be represented in the peripheral blood by altered trafficking and activation profiles. Objective: To evaluate the PMN trafficking and activation immunophenotypic profiles in people with a binge drinking pattern. Methods: People with binge drinking (n = 18, 8 females) or at low risk (n = 16, 13 females) based on their AUDIT and HEPCA scores were studied. Hematic biometry and liver enzyme tests were conducted. Peripheral blood leukocytes were stained for CCR5, CCR4, and CXCR4 (trafficking) and CD69 and CD127 (activation). PMNs and monocytes were analyzed by FACS. The data were analyzed using the T-test and Mann–Whitney’s U-test for contrasts and principal component and Fuzzy C means analyses for clustering, with p < 0.05 considered significant. Results: Compared to the low-risk group, the binge group showed higher CCR5 expression on PMNs, decreases in the CD69 percentage and positive PMNs per microliter, and decreased CXCR4 expression on monocytes. Six immunophenotypical clusters were identified, all of which were distributed following the CCR5 and CXCR4 main vectors. Conclusion: Young adult binge drinkers have differential PMN trafficking and activation immunophenotypes, which could be related to the initial onset of alcoholic liver disease and a systemic inflammatory state in response to their alcohol consumption pattern. These findings could lead to the future development of an early diagnostic tool. © 2018 Taylor & Francis."

Our algorithm uses the Pascal matrix that is built from the rows of a Pascal Triangle. The inverse transformation is obtained with the Pascal matrix without computing the determinant of the system, which simplifies the process to obtain the associated analog transfer function H(s) if the discrete transfer function H(z) is known. In addition, the algorithm is easy to program on a personal computer or scientific calculator because all the computations are made using matrices.

20804,Α new void fraction correlation inferred from artificial neural networks for modeling two-phase flows in geothermal wells,2012,Edgar Rolando Santoyo Gutiérrez,Instituto de Energías Renovables (IER),,,983004,10.1016/j.cageo.2011.08.001,http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=aps&AN=73569530&site=ehost-live,IA,Artificial Intelligence; Geoscience,Correlation (Statistics); Artificial neural networks; Mathematical models; Two-phase flow; Empirical research; Back propagation; Simulation methods & models,"Abstract: A new empirical void fraction correlation was developed using artificial neural network (ANN) techniques. The artificial networks were trained using the backpropagation algorithm and production data obtained from a worldwide database of geothermal wells. Wellhead pressure, steam quality, wellbore diameter, the fluid density and viscosity, and the dimensionless numbers Reynolds, Weber, and Froude were used as main input parameters. The target ANN output was defined by the optimized void fraction values (α opt ), which were calculated from the numerical modeling of two-phase flow using GEOWELLS (a wellbore simulator). The Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm, the hyperbolic tangent sigmoid, and the linear activation functions were used for the development of the ANN model. The best ANN learning was achieved with an architecture of six neurons in the hidden layer, which made it possible to obtain a set of void fractions (α ANN ) with a good accuracy (R 2 =0.9722). These void fraction estimates were used to obtain the new correlation, which was later coupled into the simulator GEOWELLS for the prediction of pressure gradients in two-phase geothermal wells. The accuracy of the new correlation (α ANN ) was evaluated by a statistical comparison between simulated pressure gradients and measured field data. These simulation results were also compared with those data calculated by using Duns-Ros and Dix correlations, which were also programmed into GEOWELLS. Pressure gradients predicted with the new α ANN correlation showed a better agreement with measured field data, which was also confirmed by the lower values of some statistical parameters (MPE, RMSE, and Theil''s U). The statistical evaluation demonstrated the efficiency of the new correlation to predict void fractions and pressure gradients with a better accuracy, in comparison to the other existing correlations. These successful results suggest the use of the new correlation (α ANN ) for the analysis of two-phase flow mechanisms of geothermal wells.
